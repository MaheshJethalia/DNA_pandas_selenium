Epub 2010 Dec 8.,"Mihalache F1, Höblinger A, Grünhage F, Krawczyk M, Gärtner BC, Acalovschi M, Sauerbruch T, Lammert F, Zimmer V.","Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Alpha1-antitrypsin (α1AT) deficiency caused by Z allele homozygosity represents a well-established risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Previous studies have also implicated α1AT Z heterozygosity in cholangiocarcinogenesis.
AIM:
To assess the 'common' Z and S alleles as well as the promoter variant rs8004738 for association with cholangiocarcinoma.
METHODS:
We genotyped 182 Caucasian patients and 350 controls for rs28929474 (Z), rs17580 (S) and the variant rs8004738. Exploratory analyses were performed in relation to gender and cholangiocarcinoma localisation.
RESULTS:
rs28929474 was significantly enriched in the cholangiocarcinoma group (4.1 vs. 1.7%; OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.14-5.32; Bonferroni corrected p(c) = 0.036), reinforced by Armitage trend testing (OR 2.53; p(c) = 0.032). The rs8004738 (promoter) minor allele tended to be overrepresented in Z heterozygotes (30.0 vs. 16.7%: P = 0.13). Exploratory data analyses suggested a high genetic risk for extrahepatic tumour localisation (OR 3.0; p(c) = 0.016) and potentially female Z allele carriers (OR 3.37; unadjusted P = 0.022, p(c) = 0.088).
CONCLUSIONS:
These data point to a novel role of α1AT Z heterozygosity as a potential genetic susceptibility factor for cholangiocarcinoma formation and suggest a contribution of aberrant α1AT function in biliary carcinogenesis. However, given the overall low rs28929474 minor allele frequency, larger studies are warranted to confirm and extend our findings.

Susceptibility to infection by bacterium such as Bacillus anthracis has a genetic basis in mice and may also have a genetic basis in humans. In the limited human cases of inhalation anthrax, studies suggest that not all individuals exposed to anthrax spores were infected, but rather, individuals with underlying lung disease, particularly asthma, sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, might be more susceptible. In this study, we determined if polymorphisms in genes important in innate immunity are associated with increased susceptibility to infectious and non-infectious lung diseases, particularly tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, respectively, and therefore might be a risk factor for inhalation anthrax. Examination of 45 non-synonymous polymorphisms in ten genes: p47phox (NCF1), p67phox (NCF2), p40phox (NCF4), p22phox (CYBA), gp91phox (CYBB), DUOX1, DUOX2, TLR2, TLR9 and alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) in a cohort of 95 lung disease individuals and 95 control individuals did not show an association of these polymorphisms with increased susceptibility to lung disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16608528?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, caused by the Z allele (p.E342K) and S allele (p.E264V) in the SERPINA1 gene, can induce liver and pulmonary disease. Different mechanisms appear to be responsible for the pathogenesis of these divergent disease expressions. The c.-1973T >C polymorphism located in the SERPINA1 promoter region is found more frequent in A1AT deficiency patients with liver disease compared to patients with pulmonary disease, but data are lacking regarding contribution to the development of liver diseases caused by other aetiologies.
AIM:
To study the prevalence of c.-1973T >C, Z allele and S allele in a cohort of patients with liver disease of various aetiologies compared with healthy controls and to evaluate its effect on disease progression.
METHODS:
A total of 297 patients with liver disease from various aetiologies and 297 age and gender matched healthy controls were included. The c.-1973T >C polymorphism and Z and S alleles of the SERPINA1 gene were analyzed by real-time PCR.
RESULTS:
c.-1973T >C was similarly distributed between patients with liver disease of various origins and healthy controls. Furthermore, the distribution of c.-1973T >C was independent from aetiology subgroup. In patients with liver disease mean ages at of onset of liver disease were 44.4, 42.3 and 40.7 years for the c.-1973 T/T, T/C and C/C genotype respectively (NS). S allele heterozygosity was increased in patients with drug induced liver injury (DILI), (OR 4.3; 95%CI 1.1-17.2).
CONCLUSION:
In our study, c.-1973T >C polymorphism was not a risk factor for liver disease of various aetiologies. In addition, S allele heterozygosity might contribute to the development of DILI.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20170533?dopt=Abstract

RATIONALE:
α1-Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is one of the commonest rare respiratory disorders worldwide. Diagnosis, assessment of risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and management of replacement therapy require the availability of precise and updated ranges for protein serum levels.
OBJECTIVE:
This paper aims to provide ranges of serum AAT according to the main genotype classes in the general population.
METHODS:
The authors correlated mean AAT serum levels with the main SERPINA1 variants (M1Ala/M1Val (rs6647), M3 (rs1303), M2/M4 (rs709932), S (rs17580) and Z (rs28929474)) in 6057 individuals enrolled in the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA) cohort.
RESULTS:
The following ranges (5th-95th percentile) of AAT were found in the serum (g/litre): 1.050-1.640 for PI*MM, 0.880-1.369 for PI*MS, 0.730-1.060 for PI*SS, 0.660-0.997 for PI*MZ and 0.490-0.660 for PI*SZ. There was very little overlap in AAT serum levels between genotype classes generally not believed to confer an enhanced health risk (MM and MS) and those associated with an intermediate AAT deficiency and a potentially mildly enhanced health risk (SS, MZ).
CONCLUSION:
This work resulted in three important findings: technically updated and narrower serum ranges for AAT according to PI genotype; a suggestion for a population-based 'protective threshold' of AAT serum level, used in decision-making for replacement therapy; and more precise ranges framing the intermediate AAT deficiency area, a potential target for future primary prevention.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22426792?dopt=Abstract

Alpha1-antitrypsin variant protein was purified to homogeneity from a PI S-S subject with a mild deficiency of plasma trypsin inhibiting capacity. Molecular weight, specific trypsin inhibitory activity, and composition of amino acids and carbohydrates were similar to the proteins purified from Pi M-M individuals with normal alpha1-antitrypsin activity. The structural difference between the normal and the variant alpha1-antitrypsin was elucidated by peptide mapping of their tryptic digests. An amino acid substitution of glutamic acid in the normal protein to valine in the variant protein was found.

alpha 1-Antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency is a hereditary disorder associated with reduced serum alpha 1AT levels and the development of pulmonary emphysema. An alpha 1AT gene is defined as ""Null"" when no alpha 1AT in serum is attributed to that alpha 1AT gene. Although all alpha 1AT Null genes have identical phenotypic consequences (i.e. no detectable alpha 1AT in the serum), different genotypic mechanisms can cause the Null state. This study defines the molecular basis for the alpha 1AT gene Nullmattawa, identified and cloned from genomic DNA of an individual with the Null-Null phenotype and emphysema resulting from the heterozygous inheritance of the Nullmattawa and Nullbellingham genes. Sequencing of exons Ic-V and all exon-intron junctions of the Nullmattawa gene demonstrated it was identical to the common normal M1(Val213) alpha 1AT gene except for the insertion of a single nucleotide within the coding region of exon V, causing a 3' frameshift with generation of a premature stop signal. Family analysis using oligonucleotide probes specific for the Nullmattawa sequence demonstrated the gene was inherited in an autosomal fashion. Examination of blood monocytes demonstrated that a normal-sized, 1.8-kb alpha 1AT mRNA transcript is associated with the Nullmattawa gene and in vitro translation of mRNA with the Nullmattawa mutation showed it translated at a normal rate but produced a truncated alpha 1AT protein. Additionally, retroviral transfer of the alpha 1AT Nullmattawa cDNA to murine fibroblasts demonstrated no detectable intracellular or secreted alpha 1AT, despite the presence of alpha 1AT Nullmattawa mRNA transcripts. These findings are consistent with the concept that the molecular pathophysiology of Nullmattawa is likely manifested at a posttranslational level. The identification of the Nullmattawa gene supports the concept that Null alpha 1AT alleles represent a heterogenous group in which very different mechanisms cause the identical phenotypic state.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2539391?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Severe alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a strong risk factor for COPD. But the impact of gene variants resulting in mild or intermediate AAT deficiency on the longitudinal course of respiratory health remains controversial. There is indication from experimental studies that pro-inflammatory agents like cigarette smoke can interact with these variants and thus increase the risk of adverse respiratory health effects. Therefore, we tested the effect of the presence of a protease inhibitor (Pi) S or Z allele (PiMS and PiMZ) on the change in lung function in different inflammation-exposed subgroups of a large, population-based cohort study.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
The SAPALDIA population includes over 4600 subjects from whom SERPINA1 genotypes for S and Z alleles, spirometry and respiratory symptoms at baseline and after 11 years follow-up, as well as proxies for inflammatory conditions, such as detailed smoking history, obesity and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), were available. All analyses were performed by applying multivariate regression models. There was no overall unfavourable effect of PiMS or PiMZ genotype on lung function change. We found indication that PiZ heterozygosity interacted with inflammatory stimuli leading to an accelerated decline in measures in use as indices for assessing mild airway obstruction. Obese individuals with genotype PiMM had an average annual decline in the forced mid expiratory flow (ΔFEF25-75%) of 58.4 ml whereas in obese individuals with PiMZ it amounted to 92.2 ml (p = 0.03). Corresponding numbers for persistent smokers differed even more strongly (66.8 ml (PiMM) vs. 108.2 ml (PiMZ), p = 0.005). Equivalent, but less strong associations were observed for the change in the FEV1/FVC ratio.
CONCLUSIONS:
We suggest that, in addition to the well established impact of the rare PiZZ genotype, one Z allele may be sufficient to accelerate lung function decline in population subgroups characterized by elevated levels of low grade inflammation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22912729?dopt=Abstract

INTRODUCTION:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by restricted airflow. The best-documented genetic factor is alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). AAT is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene. The PiZ (rs28929474) and PiS (rs17580) variants are believed to cause severe AAT deficiency and are linked to a high risk of developing COPD. This study sought to identify whether genetic polymorphisms rs28929474 and rs17580 are associated with COPD susceptibility and lung function values in a Mexican mestizo population.
METHODS:
In this study, 558 smokers were included, of whom 279 had COPD and 279 did not (smokers without COPD - SWC). The PiS and PiZ variants were genotyped by allelic discrimination. Independent populations and lung function values were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. A bivariate logistic regression analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS:
Stage I and iv COPD patients showed significant differences in the frequencies of both heterozygous genotypes compared to SWC. For PiS, individuals with the heterozygous genotype AT demonstrated a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio compared to subjects with the homozygous genotype AA (P=0.037). A significant association was found between the FEV1/FVC ratio and genotype AA for PiS (OR=0.982, β coefficient=-0.019, 95% CI=0.966-0.997).
CONCLUSIONS:
COPD-causing AAT deficiency risk alleles exist at a very low frequency among Mexican mestizo population. Although they are not directly linked in our study population with disease susceptibility, these risk alleles are associated with poorer lung function measurements. It is important to characterize how often these genetic risk variants occur in other Latin American populations.

CONTEXT:
Polymorphisms in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene have been associated with exceptional longevity and lower cardiovascular risk, but associations with memory decline and dementia risk are unclear.
OBJECTIVE:
To test the hypothesis that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at CETP codon 405 (isoleucine to valine V405; SNP rs5882) is associated with a lower rate of memory decline and lower risk of incident dementia, including Alzheimer disease (AD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
Prospective cohort study comprising 608 community-dwelling adults without dementia aged 70 years or older from the Einstein Aging Study with CETP genotype available. Fifteen participants with prevalent dementia were excluded, and 70 without follow-up--63 lost to follow-up and 7 new to the study--were excluded from the Cox proportional hazards model, which included 523 participants in the analysis. Standardized neuropsychological and neurological measures were administered annually from 1994-2009. Linear mixed-effects models adjusted for sex, education, race, medical comorbidities, and apolipoprotein (APOE) epsilon4 examined associations of V405 genotype with longitudinal performance on cognitive tests of episodic memory (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test [FCSRT], possible scores of 0-48), attention (Digit Span), and psychomotor speed (Digit Symbol Substitution). The V405 genotype was the main predictor of incident dementia or AD in similarly adjusted Cox proportional hazards models with age as the time scale.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
Memory decline and incident dementia.
RESULTS:
Valine allele frequency was 43.5%. A total of 40 cases of incident dementia occurred during follow-up (mean [(SD], 4.3 [3.1] years). Compared with isoleucine homozygotes, valine homozygotes had significantly slower memory decline on the FCSRT (0.43 points per year of age for isoleucine; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.58 to -0.29 vs 0.21 points per year of age for valine; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.04; difference in linear age slope, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.41; P = .03) and no significant differences on the Digit Span or Digit Symbol Substitution tests. Valine homozygotes also had lower risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.85; P = .02) and AD (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.95; P = .04).
CONCLUSION:
This preliminary report suggests that CETP V405 valine homozygosity is associated with slower memory decline and lower incident dementia and AD risk.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20068209?dopt=Abstract

A low level of HDL-C is the most common plasma lipid abnormality observed in men with established coronary heart disease (CHD). To identify allelic variants associated with susceptibility to low HDL-C and CHD, we examined 60 candidate genes with key roles in HDL metabolism, insulin resistance, and inflammation using samples from the Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention Trial (VA-HIT; cases, n = 699) and the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS; controls, n = 705). VA-HIT was designed to examine the benefits of HDL-raising with gemfibrozil in men with low HDL-C (≤40 mg/dl) and established CHD. After adjustment for multiple testing within each gene, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) significantly associated with case status were identified in the genes encoding LIPC (rs4775065, P < 0.0001); CETP (rs5882, P = 0.0002); RXRA (rs11185660, P = 0.0021); ABCA1 (rs2249891, P = 0.0126); ABCC6 (rs150468, P = 0.0206; rs212077, P = 0.0443); CUBN (rs7893395, P = 0.0246); APOA2 (rs3813627, P = 0.0324); SELP (rs732314, P = 0.0376); and APOC4 (rs10413089, P = 0.0425). Included among the novel findings of this study are the identification of susceptibility alleles for low HDL-C/CHD risk in the genes encoding CUBN and RXRA, and the observation that genetic variation in SELP may influence CHD risk through its effects on HDL.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20855565?dopt=Abstract

The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene plays an essential role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and is a candidate susceptibility gene for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent finding suggests that the CETP I405V polymorphism (rs5882) is associated with a slower rate of memory decline and a lower risk of incident dementia. Using data from two ongoing epidemiologic clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging and dementia in the United States, the Religious Order Study and the Memory and Aging Project, we evaluated the association of the CETP I405V polymorphism (rs5882) with cognitive decline and risk of incident AD in more than 1300 participants of European ancestry. Our results suggest that the CETP I405V polymorphism was associated with a faster rather than a slower rate of decline in cognition over time, and an increased risk of incident AD. This finding is consistent with data showing that the CETP I405V is associated with increased neuritic plaque density at autopsy.

Polymorphisms in and around the Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) gene have been associated with HDL levels, risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), and response to therapy. The mechanism of action of these polymorphisms has yet to be defined. We used mRNA allelic expression and splice isoform measurements in human liver tissues to identify the genetic variants affecting CETP levels. Allelic CETP mRNA expression ratios in 56 human livers were strongly associated with several variants 2.5-7 kb upstream of the transcription start site (e.g., rs247616 p = 6.4 × 10(-5), allele frequency 33%). In addition, a common alternatively spliced CETP isoform lacking exon 9 (Δ9), has been shown to prevent CETP secretion in a dominant-negative manner. The Δ 9 expression ranged from 10 to 48% of total CETP mRNA in 94 livers. Increased formation of this isoform was exclusively associated with an exon 9 polymorphism rs5883-C>T (p = 6.8 × 10(-10)) and intron 8 polymorphism rs9930761-T>C (5.6 × 10(-8)) (in high linkage disequilibrium with allele frequencies 6-7%). rs9930761 changes a key splicing branch point nucleotide in intron 8, while rs5883 alters an exonic splicing enhancer sequence in exon 9.The effect of these polymorphisms was evaluated in two clinical studies. In the Whitehall II study of 4745 subjects, both rs247616 and rs5883T/rs9930761C were independently associated with increased HDL-C levels in males with similar effect size (rs247616 p = 9.6 × 10(-28) and rs5883 p = 8.6 × 10(-10), adjusted for rs247616). In an independent multiethnic US cohort of hypertensive subjects with CAD (INVEST-GENE), rs5883T/rs9930761C alone were significantly associated with increased incidence of MI, stroke, and all-cause mortality in males (rs5883: OR 2.36 (CI 1.29-4.30), p = 0.005, n = 866). These variants did not reach significance in females in either study. Similar to earlier results linking low CETP activity with poor outcomes in males, our results suggest genetic, sex-dependent CETP splicing effects on cardiovascular risk by a mechanism independent of circulating HDL-C levels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22403620?dopt=Abstract

With an ever-increasing resource of validated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the limiting factors in genome-wide association analysis have become genotyping capacity and the availability of DNA. We provide a proof of concept of the use of pooled DNA as a means of efficiently screening SNPs and prioritizing them for further study. This approach reduces the final number of SNPs that undergo full, sample-by-sample genotyping as well as the quantity of DNA used overall. We have examined 15 SNPs in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene, a gene previously demonstrated to be associated with serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The SNPs were amplified in two pools of DNA derived from groups of individuals with extremely high and extremely low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, respectively. P values <0.05 were obtained for 14 SNPs, supporting the described association. Genotyping of the individual samples showed that the average margin of error in frequency estimate was approximately 4% when pools were used. These findings clearly demonstrate the potential of pooling techniques and their associated technologies as an initial screen in the search for genetic associations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12475937?dopt=Abstract

Haplotypes, combinations of several phase-determined polymorphic markers, are extremely valuable for studies of disease association and chromosome evolution. Here we describe a technique called M1-PCR (M for ""multiplex"" and 1 for ""single-copy DNA molecules"") that enables direct molecular haplotyping of several polymorphic markers separated by as many as 24 kb. A genomic DNA sample first is diluted to approximately single-copy. The haplotype is directly determined by simultaneously genotyping several polymorphic markers in the same reaction with a multiplex PCR and base extension reaction. This approach does not rely on pedigree data and does not require previous amplification of the entire genomic region containing the selected markers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12802015?dopt=Abstract

Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) plays a key role in remodeling triglyceride-rich particles and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). We investigated CETP sequence variants in response to long-term overfeeding (100 days) in 12 pairs of male monozygotic twins (mean age+/-S.D.: 21+/-2 years). Body fat mass (FM), abdominal subcutaneous (ASF) and visceral fat (AVF), and plasma lipoproteins were determined. The CETP variants C>T/In9 (rs289714) and G>A/Ex14 (rs5882, or I405V) were investigated by RFLP-PCR methodologies. Before overfeeding, the CETP CC/In9 (n=18) genotype was associated with lower FM compared to the C>T/In9 heterozygotes. Overfeeding induced more FM and ASF accretion in C>T/In9 carriers (P<or=0.05). CETP V405V homozygotes (n=8) had lower BMI, FM, and ASF before overfeeding than those with the I405I (n=6) or I405V (n=10) genotypes. However, V405V subjects had the largest gain in AVF with overfeeding (P=0.02). Decreases from baseline were significantly different across the I405V genotypes for HDL-C, HDL-Apo AI, HDL(2), and HDL(3) (P<or=0.05).

A cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) genotype (V/V homozygosity for I405V, NCBI dbSNP rs5882) has been associated with preservation of cognitive function in old age, in addition to its associations with exceptional longevity and cardiovascular disease. We tested the hypotheses that this polymorphism was associated with either level of cognitive function or lifetime cognitive change in 525 participants who took part in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932. Participants took the same well-validated mental ability test at ages 11 and 79. Scores were also available for several other mental ability tests at age 79, and history of cardiovascular disease was available. Frequency of the V/I genotype was slightly greater than expected in the sample, possibly consistent with some role for the V polymorphism in longevity, and the V/V genotype was associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular disease history. There were, however, no significant associations of CETP genotype with either childhood IQ or current cognitive function in old age, or with lifetime change in cognitive function.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17531380?dopt=Abstract

The exceptional longevity of centenarians is due in part to inherited genetic factors, as deduced from data that show that first degree relatives of centenarians live longer and have reduced overall mortality. In recent years, a number of groups have performed genetic association studies on long-living individuals (LLI) and young controls to identify alleles that are either positively or negatively selected in the centenarian population as consequence of a demographic pressure. Many of the reported studies have shown genetic loci associated with longevity. Of these, with the exception of APOE, none have been convincingly reproduced. We validated our populations by typing the APOE locus. In addition, we used 749 American Caucasian LLI, organized in two independent tiers and 355 American Caucasian controls in the attempt to replicate previously published findings. We tested Klotho (KL)-VS variant (rs952706), Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) I405V (rs5882), Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Q192R (rs662), Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) -641C/A (rs2542052), Microsomal Transfer Protein (MTP) -493G/T (rs2866164) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon2 and epsilon4 isoforms, (rs7412 and rs429358) haplotypes respectively. Our results show that, at present, except for APOE, none of the selected genes show association with longevity if carefully tested in a large cohort of LLI and their controls, pointing to the need of larger populations for case-control studies in extreme longevity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18034366?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
One of the challenges of the analysis of pooling-based genome wide association studies is to identify authentic associations among potentially thousands of false positive associations.
RESULTS:
We present a hierarchical and modular approach to the analysis of genome wide genotype data that incorporates quality control, linkage disequilibrium, physical distance and gene ontology to identify authentic associations among those found by statistical association tests. The method is developed for the allelic association analysis of pooled DNA samples, but it can be easily generalized to the analysis of individually genotyped samples. We evaluate the approach using data sets from diverse genome wide association studies including fetal hemoglobin levels in sickle cell anemia and a sample of centenarians and show that the approach is highly reproducible and allows for discovery at different levels of synthesis.
CONCLUSION:
Results from the integration of Bayesian tests and other machine learning techniques with linkage disequilibrium data suggest that we do not need to use too stringent thresholds to reduce the number of false positive associations. This method yields increased power even with relatively small samples. In fact, our evaluation shows that the method can reach almost 70% sensitivity with samples of only 100 subjects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194558?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Few genetic factors predisposing to the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been identified, but the pathology itself seems to be a true multifactorial disease in which complex interactions between environmental and genetic susceptibility factors take place. The purpose of this study was to approach genetic data with an innovative statistical method such as artificial neural networks to identify a possible genetic background predisposing to the disease. A DNA multiarray panel was applied to genotype more than 60 polymorphisms within 35 genes selected from pathways of lipid and homocysteine metabolism, regulation of blood pressure, coagulation, inflammation, cellular adhesion and matrix integrity, in 54 sporadic ALS patients and 208 controls. Advanced intelligent systems based on novel coupling of artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms have been applied. The results obtained have been compared with those derived from the use of standard neural networks and classical statistical analysis
RESULTS:
Advanced intelligent systems based on novel coupling of artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms have been applied. The results obtained have been compared with those derived from the use of standard neural networks and classical statistical analysis. An unexpected discovery of a strong genetic background in sporadic ALS using a DNA multiarray panel and analytical processing of the data with advanced artificial neural networks was found. The predictive accuracy obtained with Linear Discriminant Analysis and Standard Artificial Neural Networks ranged from 70% to 79% (average 75.31%) and from 69.1 to 86.2% (average 76.6%) respectively. The corresponding value obtained with Advanced Intelligent Systems reached an average of 96.0% (range 94.4 to 97.6%). This latter approach allowed the identification of seven genetic variants essential to differentiate cases from controls: apolipoprotein E arg158cys; hepatic lipase -480 C/T; endothelial nitric oxide synthase 690 C/T and glu298asp; vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor seven arg353glu, glycoprotein Ia/IIa 873 G/A and E-selectin ser128arg.
CONCLUSION:
This study provides an alternative and reliable method to approach complex diseases. Indeed, the application of a novel artificial intelligence-based method offers a new insight into genetic markers of sporadic ALS pointing out the existence of a strong genetic background.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18513389?dopt=Abstract

Variations in candidate genes participating in oxidative stress, inflammation, and their interactions are potentially associated with diseases of atherosclerotic origin. We investigated independent and joint associations of variations in cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), interleukin-8 (IL8), peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-alpha (PPARA), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) genes with incident nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke. In a population-based case-control study, patients (848 with MI and 368 with ischemic stroke) and controls (2,682) were recruited from postmenopausal women and hypertensive men/women who were members of Group Health in western Washington State. Common tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; n=34) representing gene-wide variations were selected from gene sequencing data using pairwise linkage disequilibrium. Haplotypes were inferred using a modified expectation maximization algorithm. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated individual haplotype and SNP-disease associations in log-additive models. Global haplotype tests assessed overall gene-disease associations. Logic regression was used to evaluate gene-gene interactions. False discovery rates and permutation tests were used for multiple testing adjustment in evaluating independent associations and interactions, respectively. Overall, gene-wide variations in PPARA and TLR4 genes were associated with MI. The minor allele of the PPARA SNP, rs4253623, was associated with a higher risk of MI (odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.46), whereas the minor allele of the TLR4 SNP, rs1927911, was associated with a lower risk of MI (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.99). No within-gene or gene-gene interaction was associated with MI or ischemic stroke risk. In conclusion, potential SNP-disease associations identified in the present study are novel and need further investigation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18549840?dopt=Abstract

Although Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between lipoprotein particles and thus plays a crucial role in reverse cholesterol transport, the association of variations in the CETP gene with acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains unclear. In this study we examined whether common genetic variation in the CETP gene is related to early-onset non-fatal MI risk in a population-based case-control study from western Washington State. Genotyping for the CETP -2708 G/A, -971 A/G, -629 A/C, Intron-I TaqI G/A and exon-14 A/G (I405V) SNPs was performed in 578 cases with first acute non-fatal MI and in 666 demographically similar controls, free of clinical cardiovascular disease, identified randomly from the community. In-person interviews and non-fasting blood specimens provided data on coronary heart disease risk factors. In men, there was little evidence for an association between single SNPs and MI risk, but in women the age- and race-adjusted OR was found to be significant in 4 out of the 5 CETP single variants. Haplotype analysis revealed two haplotypes associated with MI risk among men. As compared to men homozygous for the most common haplotype D (-2708 G, -971 G, -629 C, TaqI G and exon-14 A), the fully-adjusted multiplicative model identified haplotype G (-2708 G, -971 A, -629 A, TaqI G and exon-14 G) was associated with a 4.0-6.0-fold increased risk of MI for each additional copy; [95%CI 2.4-14.8] and haplotype B (-2708 G, -971 G, -629 A, TaqI A and exon-14 A) showed a significant decreased risk for early onset MI [OR = 0.18; 95%CI 0.04 - 0.75]. An evolutionary-based haplotype analysis indicated that the two haplotypes associated with the MI risk are most evolutionarily divergent from the other haplotypes. Variation at the CETP gene locus is associated with the risk of early-onset non-fatal MI. This association was found to be independent of HDL-C levels. These data and the sex-specific findings require confirmation in other populations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18637884?dopt=Abstract

The known genetic variants determining plasma HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels explain only part of its variation. Three hundred eighty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 251 genes based on pathways potentially relevant to HDL-C metabolism were selected and genotyped in 3,575 subjects from the Doetinchem cohort, which was examined thrice over 11 years. Three hundred fifty-three SNPs in 239 genes passed the quality-control criteria. Seven SNPs [rs1800777 and rs5882 in cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP); rs3208305, rs328, and rs268 in LPL; rs1800588 in LIPC; rs2229741 in NRIP1] were associated with plasma HDL-C levels with false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted q values (FDR_q) < 0.05. Five other SNPs (rs17585739 in SC4MOL, rs11066322 in PTPN11, rs4961 in ADD1, rs6060717 near SCAND1, and rs3213451 in MBTPS2 in women) were associated with plasma HDL-C levels with FDR_q between 0.05 and 0.2. Two less well replicated associations (rs3135506 in APOA5 and rs1800961 in HNF4A) known from the literature were also observed, but their significance disappeared after adjustment for multiple testing (P = 0.008, FDR_q = 0.221 for rs3135506; P = 0.018, FDR_q = 0.338 for rs1800961, respectively). In addition to replication of previous results for candidate genes (CETP, LPL, LIPC, HNF4A, and APOA5), we found interesting new candidate SNPs (rs2229741 in NRIP1, rs3213451 in MBTPS2, rs17585739 in SC4MOL, rs11066322 in PTPN11, rs4961 in ADD1, and rs6060717 near SCAND1) for plasma HDL-C levels that should be evaluated further.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18660489?dopt=Abstract

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles exhibit multiple antiatherogenic effects. They are key players in the reverse cholesterol transport which shuttles cholesterol from peripheral cells (e.g. macrophages) to the liver or other tissues. This complex process is thought to represent the basis for the antiatherogenic properties of HDL particles. The amount of cholesterol transported in HDL particles is measured as HDL cholesterol (HDLC) and is inversely correlated with the risk for coronary artery disease: an increase of 1mg/dL of HDLC levels is associated with a 2% and 3% decrease of the risk for coronary artery disease in men and women, respectively. Genetically determined conditions with high HDLC levels (e.g. familial hyperalphalipoproteinemia) often coexist with longevity, and higher HDLC levels were found among healthy elderly individuals. HDLC levels are under considerable genetic control with heritability estimates of up to 80%. The identification and characterization of genetic variants associated with HDLC concentrations can provide new insights into the background of longevity. This review provides an extended overview on the current genetic-epidemiological evidence from association studies on genes involved in HDLC metabolism. It provides a path through the jungle of association studies which are sometimes confusing due to the varying and sometimes erroneous names of genetic variants, positions and directions of associations. Furthermore, it reviews the recent findings from genome-wide association studies which have identified new genes influencing HDLC levels. The yet identified genes together explain only a small amount of less than 10% of the HDLC variance, which leaves an enormous room for further yet to be identified genetic variants. This might be accomplished by large population-based genome-wide meta-analyses and by deep-sequencing approaches on the identified genes. The resulting findings will probably result in a re-drawing and extension of the involved metabolic pathways of HDLC metabolism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19041386?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
Ischemic stroke is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component. Pathways, including lipid metabolism, systemic chronic inflammation, coagulation, blood pressure regulation, and cellular adhesion, have been implicated in stroke pathophysiology, and candidate gene polymorphisms in these pathways have been proposed as genetic risk factors.
METHODS:
We genotyped 105 simple deletions and single nucleotide polymorphisms from 64 candidate genes in 3550 patients and 6560 control subjects from 6 case-control association studies conducted in the United States, Europe, and China. Genotyping was performed using the same immobilized probe typing system and meta-analyses were based on summary logistic regressions for each study. The primary analyses were fixed-effects meta-analyses adjusting for age and sex with additive, dominant, and recessive models of inheritance.
RESULTS:
Although 7 polymorphisms showed a nominal additive association, none remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. In contrast, after stratification for hypertension, 2 lymphotoxin-alpha polymorphisms, which are in strong linkage disequilibrium, were significantly associated among nonhypertensive individuals: LTA 252A>G (additive model; OR, 1.41 with 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.65; P=0.00002) and LTA 26Thr>Asn (OR, 1.19 with 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.34; P=0.003). LTA 252A>G remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing using either the false discovery rate or by permutation testing. The 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms showed no association in hypertensive subjects (eg, LTA 252A>G, OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.03; P=0.17).
CONCLUSIONS:
These observations may indicate an important role of LTA-mediated inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19131662?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, complex disorder; however, genetic factors have been suggested to play a role in the disease development. We therefore conducted a multi-locus genetic study examining the potential associations of candidate gene variants in inflammation, thrombosis, coagulation, and lipid metabolism pathways, individually or interactively, with risk of recurrent VTE.
METHODS:
Using DNA samples collected at baseline in the Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism trial (PREVENT), we genotyped 86 candidate genes polymorphisms among 43 individuals who subsequently developed recurrent VTE and among 396 individuals who remained free of recurrent event over a mean follow-up period of 2.1 years to prospectively determine whether these gene polymorphisms contribute to the risk of recurrent VTE.
RESULTS:
Using a single-marker 'uncorrected' analysis, CCR5 A(-2459)G [rs1799864], MMP3 5A(-1171)6A [rs3025058] and PON1 gln192arg [rs662] gene variants were associated with increased risk, and CETP C(-629)A [rs1800775] gene variant with reduced risk of recurrent VTE, respectively. Furthermore, potentially important gene-gene-interactions were detected by the Monte Carlo Markov chain Logic Regression method.
CONCLUSIONS:
Although the present findings are hypothesis-generating and require confirmation in an independent investigation, our study provides a practical example of detecting epistasis in common, complex diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19263529?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
The application of a subset of single nucleotide polymorphisms, the tagSNPs, can be useful in capturing untyped SNPs information in a genomic region. TagSNP transferability from the HapMap dataset to admixed populations is of uncertain value due population structure, admixture, drift and recombination effects. In this work an empirical dataset from a Brazilian admixed sample was evaluated against the HapMap population to measure tagSNP transferability and the relative loss of variability prediction.
METHODS:
The transferability study was carried out using SNPs dispersed over four genomic regions: the PTPN22, HMGCR, VDR and CETP genes. Variability coverage and the prediction accuracy for tagSNPs in the selected genomic regions of HapMap phase II were computed using a prediction accuracy algorithm. Transferability of tagSNPs and relative loss of prediction were evaluated according to the difference between the Brazilian sample and the pooled and single HapMap population estimates.
RESULTS:
Each population presented different levels of prediction per gene. On average, the Brazilian (BRA) sample displayed a lower power of prediction when compared to HapMap and the pooled sample. There was a relative loss of prediction for BRA when using single HapMap populations, but a pooled HapMap dataset generated minor loss of variability prediction and lower standard deviations, except at the VDR locus at which loss was minor using CEU tagSNPs.
CONCLUSION:
Studies that involve tagSNP selection for an admixed population should not be generally correlated with any specific HapMap population and can be better represented with a pooled dataset in most cases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19682379?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Genome-wide genetic association analysis represents an opportunity for a comprehensive survey of the genes governing lipid metabolism, potentially revealing new insights or even therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease and related metabolic disorders.
METHODS AND RESULTS:
We have performed large-scale, genome-wide genetic analysis among 6382 white women with replication in 2 cohorts of 970 additional white men and women for associations between common single-nucleotide polymorphisms and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein(Apo) A1, and ApoB. Genome-wide associations (P < 5 x 10(-8)) were found at the PCSK9 gene, the APOB gene, theLPL gene, the APOA1-APOA5 locus, the LIPC gene, the CETP gene, the LDLR gene, and the APOE locus. In addition,genome-wide associations with triglycerides at the GCKR gene confirm and extend emerging links between glucose and lipid metabolism. Still other genome-wide associations at the 1p13.3 locus are consistent with emerging biological properties for a region of the genome, possibly related to the SORT1 gene. Below genome-wide significance, our study provides confirmatory evidence for associations at 5 novel loci with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides reported recently in separate genome-wide association studies. The total proportion of variance explained by common variation at the genome-wide candidate loci ranges from 4.3% for triglycerides to 12.6% for ApoB.

BACKGROUND:
Recent trial data have challenged the hypothesis that cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have causal roles in atherothrombosis. One method to evaluate this issue is to examine whether polymorphisms in the CETP gene that impact on HDL-C levels also impact on the future development of myocardial infarction.
METHODS AND RESULTS:
In a prospective cohort of 18 245 initially healthy American women, we examined over 350 000 singe-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) first to identify loci associated with HDL-C and then to evaluate whether significant SNPs within these loci also impact on rates of incident myocardial infarction during an average 10-year follow-up period. Nine loci on 9 chromosomes had 1 or more SNPs associated with HDL-C at genome-wide statistical significance (P<5x10(-8)). However, only SNPs near or in the CETP gene at 16q13 were associated with both HDL-C and risk of incident myocardial infarction (198 events). For example, SNP rs708272 in the CETP gene was associated with a per-allele increase in HDL-C levels of 3.1 mg/dL and a concordant 24% lower risk of future myocardial infarction (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.94), consistent with recent meta-analysis. Independent and again concordant effects on HDL-C and incident myocardial infarction were also observed at the CETP locus for rs4329913 and rs7202364. Adjustment for HDL-C attenuated but did not eliminate these effects.
CONCLUSIONS:
In this prospective cohort of initially healthy women, SNPs at the CETP locus impact on future risk of myocardial infarction, supporting a causal role for CETP in atherothrombosis, possibly through an HDL-C mediated pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20031564?dopt=Abstract

OBJECTIVE:
Genetic variability in the NR1H3 gene (encoding LXRα) and in several of its target genes is associated with serum HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations. We sought to assess if these associations could be detected in adolescents.
METHODS:
Thirty-nine polymorphisms in NR1H3, ABCA1, APOE, CETP, PLTP and LPL were analysed in the HELENA study (n = 1144 European adolescents).
RESULTS:
The minor alleles of rs11039155 in NR1H3, rs2575879 in ABCA1, rs708272, rs17231506 and rs5882 in CETP and rs328 in LPL were associated with higher serum HDL-C concentrations (p ≤ 0.0012). The minor alleles of rs12221497 in NR1H3, rs1800978 in ABCA1 and the APOE ɛ4 allele were associated with lower HDL-C concentrations (p ≤ 0.01). The combined set of associated polymorphisms accounted for ∼6.6% of the variance in HDL-C.
CONCLUSION:
We report for the first time that polymorphisms in NR1H3 and its target genes ABCA1, APOE, CETP and LPL contribute to the genetic variance for HDL-C concentrations in adolescence.

Significant predictors (where P values were adjusted for false discovery rate) included type of blood sample [whole blood (WB) vs. plasma-depleted WB; P < 0.001] used for folate analysis, gender (P < 0.001), and SNP in genes SPTLC1 (rs11790991; P = 0.040), CRBP2 (rs2118981; P < 0.001), BHMT (rs3733890; P = 0.019), and CETP (rs5882; P = 0.017). Significant 2-way interaction effects included gender × MTHFR (rs1801131; P = 0.012), gender × CRBP2 (rs2118981; P = 0.011), and gender × SCARB1 (rs83882; P = 0.003). The relation of nHcy concentrations with the significant SNP (SPTLC1, BHMT, CETP, CRBP2, MTHFR, and SCARB1) is of interest, especially because we surveyed the main and interaction effects in healthy adults, but it is an important area for future study. As discussed, understanding Hcy and genetic regulation is important, because Hcy may be related to inflammation, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. We conclude that gender and SNP significantly affect nHcy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22833659?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Coronary atherosclerosis, the most common form of coronary artery disease (CAD), is characterized by accumulation of lipid in the walls of coronary arteries. Recent data from clinical trials have showed that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has causal role in the pathogenesis and development of coronary atherosclerosis. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is an important regulator of plasma HDL-C. Several genetic mutations in the CETP gene were found to be associated with HDL-C levels. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the association of HDL-C-related CETP polymorphisms and risk of coronary atherosclerosis.
METHODS:
We investigated the association of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (rs1800775, rs708272, rs5882, rs1532624, rs1864163, rs7499892, and rs9989419) in the CETP gene with the risk of coronary atherosclerosis and levels of HDL-C in a case-control study in China. Included in the study were 420 patients with coronary atherosclerosis and 424 healthy controls. SNP genotyping was performed by TaqMan allelic discrimination assay and serum lipid levels were measured by standard laboratory methods.
RESULTS:
Carriers of the AA and GA + AA genotypes of rs708272 had significant lower risks of coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.36-0.85, p = 0.003; OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.50-0.90, p = 0.007, respectively) compared to those with GG genotype. These relations remained significant after adjustment for confounding effects of age, smoking, diabetes and hypertension. The rs1800775 polymorphism was significantly associated with serum levels of HDL-C in healthy controls (p = 0.04). Besides, rs708272 was in close linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs1800775 in this study.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our findings indicated that CETP rs708272 may be associated with the risk of coronary atherosclerosis and rs1800775 may influence serum HDL-C levels in healthy controls in Chinese.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24283500?dopt=Abstract

There is an increasing interest to understand the molecular basis of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) subfractions and their association with coronary artery disease (CAD). The formation of these subfractions is greatly influenced by hepatic lipase (HL) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) enzymes. To identify genetic markers influencing LDL and HDL subfractions and their role in CAD we performed a case-control genetic association study on 117 healthy controls and 119 angiographically verified CAD patients. Biochemical analysis was performed using standard assays. HDL-C and LDL-C subfractions were estimated using precipitation methods. Genotyping of C-514T (rs1800588) in the LIPC gene for HL and I405V (rs5882) in the CETP gene was done using PCR-based restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. Both the polymorphisms were not associated with CAD. The C-514T was associated with increased HDL3-C levels in controls (P = 0.049). The I405V polymorphism was found to be associated with low levels of small dense, LDL (P = 0.038). A multiple regression analysis showed that the effects were dependent on gender and triglyceride levels. We conclude that these polymorphisms are not associated with CAD but are important determinants of HDL-C and small dense LDL particles in our population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24426196?dopt=Abstract

The Inuit population is often described as being protected against CVD due to their traditional dietary patterns and their unique genetic background. The objective of the present study was to examine gene-diet interaction effects on plasma lipid levels in the Inuit population. Data from the Qanuippitaa Nunavik Health Survey (n 553) were analysed via regression models which included the following: genotypes for thirty-five known polymorphisms (SNP) from twenty genes related to lipid metabolism; dietary fat intake including total fat (TotFat) and saturated fat (SatFat) estimated from a FFQ; plasma lipid levels, namely total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and TAG. The results demonstrate that allele frequencies were different in the Inuit population compared with the Caucasian population. Further, seven SNP (APOA1 - 75G/A (rs670), APOB XbAI (rs693), AGT M235T (rs699), LIPC 480C/T (rs1800588), APOA1 84T/C (rs5070), PPARG2 - 618C/G (rs10865710) and APOE 219G/T (rs405509)) in interaction with TotFat and SatFat were significantly associated with one or two plasma lipid parameters. Another four SNP (APOC3 3238C>G (rs5128), CETP I405V (rs5882), CYP1A1 A4889G (rs1048943) and ABCA1 Arg219Lys (rs2230806)) in interaction with either TotFat or SatFat intake were significantly associated with one plasma lipid variable. Further, an additive effect of these SNP in interaction with TotFat or SatFat intake was significantly associated with higher TC, LDL-C or TAG levels, as well as with lower HDL-C levels. In conclusion, the present study supports the notion that gene-diet interactions play an important role in modifying plasma lipid levels in the Inuit population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021345?dopt=Abstract

Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) are both major serosanguinous maculopathies among the Asian elderly. They are similar in phenotype. Genetic variants in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) pathway were discovered to be associated with AMD in two genome-wide association studies. In this study with a Chinese Han cohort, we investigated the impacts of these genetic variants on nAMD and PCV separately. The missense coding variants and previously identified variants at LIPC, ABCA1, CETP, LPL and FADS1 loci were genotyped in 157 nAMD patients, 250 PCV patients and 204 controls without any macular abnormality. The known variants in CFH, ARMS2 and near HTRA1 were also genotyped. Fasting serum cholesterol levels were determined. The variants in CFH, ARMS2 and near HTRA1 were strongly associated with both PCV (P < 10(-6), 10(-7) and 10(-7) respectively) and nAMD (P < 10(-6), 10(-16) and 10(-17) respectively). None of the studied HDL-related variants were significantly associated with nAMD. A missense variant in CETP, rs5882, was significantly associated with PCV (P = 2.73 × 10(-4)). The rs5882 GG genotype had a 3.53-fold (95% CI: 1.93-6.45) increased risk for PCV, and conferred a significantly lower serum HDL-cholesterol level for PCV patients than the AA genotype (P = 0.048). These results suggest the need to separate PCV from nAMD in association studies especially with Asian cohorts, and that the HDL pathway may involve in the pathogenesis of PCV and nAMD differently.

Several common genetic variants influence cholesterol levels, which play a key role in overall health. Myelin synthesis and maintenance are highly sensitive to cholesterol concentrations, and abnormal cholesterol levels increase the risk for various brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. We report significant associations between higher serum cholesterol (CHOL) and high-density lipoprotein levels and higher fractional anisotropy in 403 young adults (23.8 ± 2.4 years) scanned with diffusion imaging and anatomic magnetic resonance imaging at 4 Tesla. By fitting a multi-locus genetic model within white matter areas associated with CHOL, we found that a set of 18 cholesterol-related, single-nucleotide polymorphisms implicated in Alzheimer's disease risk predicted fractional anisotropy. We focused on the single-nucleotide polymorphism with the largest individual effects, CETP (rs5882), and found that increased G-allele dosage was associated with higher fractional anisotropy and lower radial and mean diffusivities in voxel-wise analyses of the whole brain. A follow-up analysis detected white matter associations with rs5882 in the opposite direction in 78 older individuals (74.3 ± 7.3 years). Cholesterol levels may influence white matter integrity, and cholesterol-related genes may exert age-dependent effects on the brain.

Variations of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein polymorphism (CETP I405V/rs5882) have been associated with an increased risk for neurodegeneration, particularly when examined in conjunction with the epsilon 4 isoform of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4). Despite these identified relationships, the impact of I405V on gray matter microstructure remains unknown. The present study examined the impact of the CETP I405V polymorphism on gray matter integrity among 52 healthy adults between ages 51 and 85. Gray matter was measured bilaterally using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Participants were grouped according to a dominant statistical model (II genotype vs. IV/VV genotypes) and secondary analyses were completed to examine the interactive effects of CETP and ApoE4 on DTI metrics. Compared to individuals with the IV/VV genotypes, II homozygotes demonstrated significantly higher MD in bilateral temporal, parietal, and occipital gray matter. Secondary analyses revealed higher FA and AD in the left temporal lobe of IV/VV genotypes with an ApoE4 allele. Our results provide preliminary evidence that CETP II homozygosity is a predisposing risk factor for gray matter abnormalities in posterior brain regions in healthy older adults, independent of an ApoE4 allele.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26253899?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) polymorphism I405V has been suggested to be involved in longevity and susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. An enhanced reverse cholesterol transport due to enhanced HDL levels has been hypothesized to be the underlying mechanism. However, clinical trials with HDL-enhancing drugs failed to show beneficial effects. Consequently, it has been postulated that genetic variations enhancing HDL levels are cardioprotective only if they also decrease LDL levels.
METHODS:
A cross-sectional study was conducted to genotype 1028 healthy blood donors and 1517 clinically well characterized elderly for CETP I405V.
RESULTS:
We could not find any association of this polymorphism with age for both, males or females, in any of these cohorts (P = 0.71 and P = 0.57, respectively, for males and P = 0.55 and P = 0.88, respectively, for females). In addition, no association with cardiovascular diseases could be observed in the elderly cohort (males OR = 1.12 and females OR = 0.88). In the same cohort, the CETP V405V genotype was associated with significantly enhanced HDL levels (P = 0.03), mostly owing to the female sex (P = 0.46 for males, P = 0.02 for females), whereas LDL and triglyceride levels were unchanged (P = 0.62 and P = 0.18, respectively).
CONCLUSION:
Our data support the recent hypothesis that variations enhancing HDL levels without affecting LDL levels are not associated with the risk for cardiovascular diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27439317?dopt=Abstract

Databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, the Cochrane Library, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure were systematically searched. Thirty-two studies were included in this meta-analysis. There was no difference in the I405V, C629A, and Taq1B polymorphisms between AD and control groups. However, stratified analysis showed that AD group had higher B2B2 genotype frequency than control group in Asian populations with APOE4+ in Taq1B. I405V and Taq1B polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of carotid atherosclerosis and longevity. The efficacy of statin therapy was not associated with Taq1B polymorphism. In conclusion, there was no association between cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene polymorphisms and the risk of AD, carotid atherosclerosis, longevity, and the efficacy of statin therapy in the pooled effects of overall population. However, the B2B2 genotype of Taq1B was associated with increased risk of AD in the Asian populations with APOE4+.

OBJECTIVES:
There are controversial results regarding the effect of the interaction of CETP polymorphisms with dietary fats on the lipid profiles. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of CETP polymorphisms (rs5882 and rs3764261) and macronutrient intakes interaction in relation to metabolic syndrome (MetS) or its components.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
In this nested case-control study, subjects were selected from among participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. Cases (n=441) were individually matched with two controls (844 non-MetS subjects). DNA samples were genotyped with HumanOmniExpress-24-v1-0 bead chips, including 649,932 SNP loci.
RESULTS:
The mean ages at baseline were 38.1±10 and 37.0±10 years in women and 36.2±11 and 36.3±11 years in men, respectively in cases and controls. We did not find significant gene-diet interactions between rs5882 and dietary macronutrient intakes in relation to MetS risk. The risk of low HDL-C was lower in the first quartile of MUFA and total fat intake in G allele carriers, compared to AA genotype group. The risk of high BP appeared to increase significantly in higher quartiles of trans-fatty acid intakes (>1.81% of total energy intake) in G allele carriers compared with the AA genotype group. No significant interactions were found between rs3764261 and macronutrient intakes in association with MetS or its components.

BACKGROUND:
An association of the Tyr402His variant of the complement factor H (CFH) gene with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been shown in several Caucasian populations, while studies for an association with other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of complement system genes have produced inconsistent results. We examined the distribution of several SNPs of complement system genes (CFH, C 2, C 3, factor B) in patients with exsudative AMD and healthy controls.
PATIENTS/MATERIALS AND METHODS:
226 patients with exsudative AMD and 179 controls without AMD were included. Genomic DNA was extracted from saliva samples.
RESULTS:
A significant association with exsudative AMD was found only for SNP rs1061170 (Y402 H) in the CFH gene. For rs1047286 (P292L) and rs2230199 (R102G) in the C 3 gene, rs547154 (IVS10) and rs9332739 (E318D) in the C 2 gene and rs4151667 (L9 H) in CFB gene, no associations with exsudative AMD were found.
CONCLUSIONS:
We have replicated an association of the Y 402 H variant with exsudative AMD in our population. Although variants R 102G, IVS10, E 318D and L 9 H have been shown to be associated with AMD in earlier studies, we could not confirm these findings. The results show that AMD has variable association patterns with rare variants in different populations.

PURPOSE:
Nonsynonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in complement component 3 (C3) alter the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This was a study of the effect of haplotypes across C3 on AMD risk.
METHODS:
Nine SNPs tagging haplotypes across C3 were genotyped on 738 subjects at the Mayo Clinic. Haplotype analyses were performed with and without conditioning on individual SNPs. Replication studies were performed using 1541 subjects from the age-related eye disease study (AREDS).
RESULTS:
Two nsSNPs located 5125 bp apart in the 5' end of C3 showed the highest association (rs1047286 or P314L, P = 9.2E-05; rs2230199 or R102G, P = 4.1E-05) with AMD. The minor alleles of both SNPs tagged a single risk haplotype. The effects of the two nsSNPs could not be distinguished due to high linkage disequilibrium. The risk SNPs preferentially promoted the development of advanced AMD relative to early AMD in both the Mayo and AREDS subjects. Haplotypes in the 3' end of the C3 locus were associated with AMD in both the Mayo and AREDS subjects. The effect persisted after conditioning on the nsSNPs only in the Mayo subjects. No interaction was found between rs2230199 and smoking or other AMD loci.
CONCLUSIONS:
nsSNPs in C3 increased the risk of developing AMD 1.8-fold for 1 risk allele or 2.4-fold for two risk alleles and were preferentially associated with advanced AMD. Further study is needed to determine whether haplotypes in the 3' end of C3 have an independent association with AMD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19234341?dopt=Abstract

PURPOSE:
The specific role of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the progression of age-related maculopathy (AMD) is not clearly understood. The present study was conducted to investigated whether variants in three susceptibility genes are differentially associated with progression to early and late AMD.
METHODS:
The Münster Ageing and Retina Study (MARS) cohort includes 722 patients with different stages of AMD. Participants were reexamined after a median of 2.6 years. The association of SNPs in the CFH, ARMS2, and C3 genes with AMD progression was evaluated in 1435 single eyes by using multivariate logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS:
CFH-rs1061170 was significantly related to the development of early (OR = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.0 for heterozygous, and OR = 2.9 [95% CI, 1.7-5.1] for homozygous allele carriers) but not to late AMD. In contrast, ARMS2-rs10490924 was associated only with progression to advanced disease (OR = 1.2 [0.7-2.1] and OR = 2.1 [1.1-3.9], respectively). The variant C3-rs2230199 showed no relation with AMD progression.
CONCLUSIONS:
The findings indicate that AMD progression is differentially affected by genotypic variants. Probably, aging processes of the human retina predispose to AMD onset in the presence of genetic variation in the complement system, which alters immunoregulatory and inflammatory responses. The specific functional role of ARMS2-rs10490924 remains as yet unknown, but it appears to mainly affect the progression to late AMD stages.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19797206?dopt=Abstract

Significant association was detected for exudative AMD with the CFH noncoding variant rs1410996. Frequencies of the risk C allele at rs1410996 were 72.0% in AMD cases versus 55.6% in controls (P < 0.001). The odds ratio for risk of AMD was 1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-3.54) for heterozygous TC genotype and 3.85 (95% CI, 1.84-8.05) for homozygous CC genotype compared with the wild TT genotype. In contrast, the C3 variants rs2230199 and rs1047286 were not associated with exudative AMD in the studied subjects. Frequencies of the risk G allele at rs2230199 and of the risk T allele at rs1047286 were 0.3% to 1.0% in both cases and controls.
CONCLUSIONS:
The data suggest that the noncoding variant rs1410996 of the CFH gene moderately increased the risk of exudative AMD in a Chinese population. The C3 variants were rare and not associated with exudative AMD in this Chinese cohort.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19850835?dopt=Abstract

PURPOSE:
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the genetic polymorphisms of complement factor 3 (C3) are associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the Chinese population.
METHODS:
A total of 123 unrelated Chinese Han patients with neovascular AMD and 130 control subjects were recruited. Their six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the C3 gene, one in the complement factor H (CFH) gene and two in the complement factor B (CFB) gene were characterized. Their genotypes, allele frequencies, and odds ratios were analyzed.
RESULTS:
The G allele of the C3 IVS2 rs2250656, but not other tested C3 SNPs of rs2230205, rs10411506, rs2230199, rs339392, and rs163913, was significantly associated with a reduced risk for AMD in the Chinese population (OR 0.605, 95% CI 0.39-0.93, p = 0.023), even after adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, CFH rs1061170, CFB rs4151667, and CFB rs641153 allele status (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.96, p = 0.033). However, the C3 haplotype of A-A-C-A-T-T was identified as a statistically significant risk factor for neovascular AMD (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.02-1.94). Furthermore, the C allele of the CFH rs1061170, but not the CFB rs4151667 and rs641153, was significnatly associated with increased risk for AMD (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.55-6.15, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION:
The G allele of C3 IVS2 rs2250656 may be a significantly protective factor for neovascular AMD in the Chinese population. This, together with low MAF of C3 R102G, may be partially responsible for the low prevalence of AMD in the Chinese population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19899988?dopt=Abstract

PURPOSE:
A non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in complement component 3 has been shown to increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We assess its effect on AMD risk in a Northern Irish sample, test for gene-gene and gene-environment interaction, and review a risk prediction model.
METHODS:
SNP rs2230199 was genotyped in 1,358 samples, which comprised 437 cases, 436 no-disease controls, and 485 participants randomly sampled from the Northern Ireland population. Allele frequencies were assessed in cases and controls. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess interaction and develop a risk prediction model.
RESULTS:
We report a minor allele frequency of 0.248 for rs2230199 in the population (n=485), 0.296 in cases (n=437), and 0.221 in controls (n=436; odds ratio [OR]=1.48; confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-1.85; p=0.0003). The significant association is retained following multivariate analysis with adjustment for age, smoking status, Complement Factor H (CFH), Age-Related Maculopathy Susceptibility 2 (ARMS2), Complement Component 2 (CC2), and Complement Factor B (CFB; OR=1.45; CI: 1.10-1.91; p=0.009). No evidence to support an interaction between any of the covariates within the regression model was found. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve calculated for the fully adjusted model, including all variables, was 0.86 for late AMD.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our study confirmed the association between Complement Component 3 (C3) and late-stage AMD. There was no evidence for an interaction with environmental exposures, nor did we find data to support a gene-gene effect.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20157618?dopt=Abstract

We executed a genome-wide association scan for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 2,157 cases and 1,150 controls. Our results validate AMD susceptibility loci near CFH (P < 10(-75)), ARMS2 (P < 10(-59)), C2/CFB (P < 10(-20)), C3 (P < 10(-9)), and CFI (P < 10(-6)). We compared our top findings with the Tufts/Massachusetts General Hospital genome-wide association study of advanced AMD (821 cases, 1,709 controls) and genotyped 30 promising markers in additional individuals (up to 7,749 cases and 4,625 controls). With these data, we identified a susceptibility locus near TIMP3 (overall P = 1.1 x 10(-11)), a metalloproteinase involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix and previously implicated in early-onset maculopathy. In addition, our data revealed strong association signals with alleles at two loci (LIPC, P = 1.3 x 10(-7); CETP, P = 7.4 x 10(-7)) that were previously associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels in blood. Consistent with the hypothesis that HDL metabolism is associated with AMD pathogenesis, we also observed association with AMD of HDL-c-associated alleles near LPL (P = 3.0 x 10(-3)) and ABCA1 (P = 5.6 x 10(-4)). Multilocus analysis including all susceptibility loci showed that 329 of 331 individuals (99%) with the highest-risk genotypes were cases, and 85% of these had advanced AMD.

Advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of late onset blindness. We present results of a genome-wide association study of 979 advanced AMD cases and 1,709 controls using the Affymetrix 6.0 platform with replication in seven additional cohorts (totaling 5,789 unrelated cases and 4,234 unrelated controls). We also present a comprehensive analysis of copy-number variations and polymorphisms for AMD. Our discovery data implicated the association between AMD and a variant in the hepatic lipase gene (LIPC) in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) pathway (discovery P = 4.53e-05 for rs493258). Our LIPC association was strongest for a functional promoter variant, rs10468017, (P = 1.34e-08), that influences LIPC expression and serum HDL levels with a protective effect of the minor T allele (HDL increasing) for advanced wet and dry AMD. The association we found with LIPC was corroborated by the Michigan/Penn/Mayo genome-wide association study; the locus near the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 was corroborated by our replication cohort for rs9621532 with P = 3.71e-09. We observed weaker associations with other HDL loci (ABCA1, P = 9.73e-04; cholesterylester transfer protein, P = 1.41e-03; FADS1-3, P = 2.69e-02). Based on a lack of consistent association between HDL increasing alleles and AMD risk, the LIPC association may not be the result of an effect on HDL levels, but it could represent a pleiotropic effect of the same functional component. Results implicate different biologic pathways than previously reported and provide new avenues for prevention and treatment of AMD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20385826?dopt=Abstract

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world. We conducted a genome-wide association study in a series of families enriched for AMD and completed a meta-analysis of this new data with results from reanalysis of an existing study of a late-stage case-control cohort. We tested the top findings for replication in 1896 cases and 1866 controls and identified two novel genetic protective factors for AMD. In addition to the complement factor H (CFH) (P=2.3 × 10⁻⁶⁴) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) (P=1.2 × 10⁻⁶⁰) loci, we observed a protective effect at rs429608, an intronic SNP in SKIV2L (P=5.3 × 10⁻¹⁵), a gene near the complement component 2 (C2)/complement factor B (BF) locus, that indicates the protective effect may be mediated by variants other than the C2/BF variants previously studied. Haplotype analysis at this locus identified three protective haplotypes defined by the rs429608 protective allele. We also identified a new potentially protective effect at rs2679798 in MYRIP (P=2.9 × 10⁻⁴), a gene involved in retinal pigment epithelium melanosome trafficking. Interestingly, MYRIP was initially identified in the family-based scan and was confirmed in the case-control set. From these efforts, we report the identification of two novel protective factors for AMD and confirm the previously known associations at CFH, ARMS2 and C3.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20861866?dopt=Abstract

Despite significant progress in the identification of genetic loci for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), not all of the heritability has been explained. To identify variants which contribute to the remaining genetic susceptibility, we performed the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies to date for advanced AMD. We imputed 6 036 699 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with the 1000 Genomes Project reference genotypes on 2594 cases and 4134 controls with follow-up replication of top signals in 5640 cases and 52 174 controls. We identified two new common susceptibility alleles, rs1999930 on 6q21-q22.3 near FRK/COL10A1 [odds ratio (OR) 0.87; P = 1.1 × 10(-8)] and rs4711751 on 6p12 near VEGFA (OR 1.15; P = 8.7 × 10(-9)). In addition to the two novel loci, 10 previously reported loci in ARMS2/HTRA1 (rs10490924), CFH (rs1061170, and rs1410996), CFB (rs641153), C3 (rs2230199), C2 (rs9332739), CFI (rs10033900), LIPC (rs10468017), TIMP3 (rs9621532) and CETP (rs3764261) were confirmed with genome-wide significant signals in this large study. Loci in the recently reported genes ABCA1 and COL8A1 were also detected with suggestive evidence of association with advanced AMD. The novel variants identified in this study suggest that angiogenesis (VEGFA) and extracellular collagen matrix (FRK/COL10A1) pathways contribute to the development of advanced AMD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21665990?dopt=Abstract

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 10% to 15% of all strokes and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in management, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate significant benefit of medical and surgical interventions, underscoring the need for the identification of novel therapeutic targets based on improved understanding of ICH pathophysiology and optimal risk stratification based on reliable and effective prognosticators. The alternative complement cascade has been implicated as an important contributor to neurological injury after ICH. Therefore, common, functionally relevant genetic variants in the key components of this pathway have been associated with greater inflammation post-ictus, further cerebral damage, and ultimately, a worse outcome. We investigated the affects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on mortality in complement component 3 C3 (rs2230199), complement component 5 C5 (rs17611), and Complement Factor H (CFH; rs1061170) genes, which are associated with the onset and progression of several neurological diseases, in a prospective cohort of patients with spontaneous ICH. From February 2009 through May 2010, adult patients with spontaneous ICH were admitted to the Columbia University Neurological Intensive Care Unit and enrolled in the Intracerebral Hemorrhage Outcomes Project. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and treatment data were prospectively collected. Buccal swabs were obtained, and isolated cells were sequenced for the aforementioned SNP. A total of 103 patients were admitted with ICH, and of these, 82 consented for genetic testing and were included in the analysis. The median age was 61 years and 39% were females. The median Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission was 11.5. The CFH SNP was significantly associated with both discharge (p = 0.01) and 6-month mortality (p = 0.02), while no such association was observed for C3 (p = 0.545 and p = 0.830) or C5 (p = 0.983 and p = 0.536) SNP. Additionally, after controlling for pertinent variables identified in the univariate analysis, the CFH genotype independently predicted mortality at discharge (p = 0.019, odds ratio [OR] 7.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-41.6) and at 6 months (p = 0.041, OR 1.822, 95% CI 1.025-3.239). The CFH genotype was also independently predictive of survival duration (p = 0.041, OR 1.822, 95% CI 1.025-3.239). We concluded that CFH Y402H polymorphism independently predicts mortality at discharge and 6-months and survival duration after spontaneous ICH.

BACKGROUND:
Genetic variants in the complement component 3 gene (C3) have been shown to be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Caucasian populations of European descent. In particular, a nonsynonymous coding variant, rs2230199 (R102G), is presumed to be the most likely causal variant in the C3 locus based on strong statistical evidence for disease association and mechanistic functional evidence. However, the risk allele is absent or rare (<1%) in Japanese and Chinese populations, and the association of R102G with AMD has not been reported in Asian populations. Genetic heterogeneity of disease-associated variants among different ethnicities is common in complex diseases. Here, we sought to examine whether other common variants in C3 are associated with wet AMD, a common advanced-stage manifestation of AMD, in a Japanese population.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
We genotyped 13 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that capture the majority of common variations in the C3 locus and tested for associations between these SNPs and wet AMD in a Japanese population comprising 420 case subjects and 197 controls. A noncoding variant in C3 (rs2241394) exhibited statistically significant evidence of association (allelic P = 8.32 × 10(-4); odds ratio = 0.48 [95% CI = 0.31-0.74] for the rs2241394 C allele). Multilocus logistic regression analysis confirmed that the effect of rs2241394 was independent of the previously described loci at ARMS2 and CFH, and that the model including variants in ARMS2 and CFH plus C3 rs2241394 provided a better fit than the model without rs2241394. We found no evidence of epistasis between variants in C3 and CFH, despite the fact that they are involved in the same biological pathway.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our study provides evidence that C3 is a common AMD-associated locus that transcends racial boundaries and provides an impetus for more detailed genetic characterization of the C3 locus in Asian populations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22174912?dopt=Abstract

AIM:
To investigate clinical presentation and genotypes in patients with simultaneous geographic atrophy (GA) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and to compare with patients with GA or CNV only.
PATIENTS AND METHODS:
Twenty patients with combined CNV-GA and 154 CNV only and 154 GA only were chosen based on clinical exam and imaging. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-rs2274700 and rs1061170 (complement factor H), rs10490924 and rs11200638 (HTRA1/LOC387715), rs2230199 (C3), rs9332739 (C2)-were genotyped using the SNaPshot method. Chi-squared tests were used for genetic analysis.
RESULTS:
In patients with CNV-GA, GA progressed slowly and often preceded CNV. CNV presented as subretinal haemorrhage or fluid, with a sudden drop in visual acuity (VA). Comparing combined CNV-GA to GA and CNV only, patients with both had a higher frequency of at-risk alleles at both SNPs within the HTRA1 gene-rs10490924 (52.5%), rs11200638 (52.6%). Statistical significance was not achieved. CNV-GA patients had no protective alleles at SNP rs9332739 (C2), compared with GA (27%) and CNV only (10%).
CONCLUSION:
There is a paucity of reports describing simultaneous CNV-GA. Clinical and genetic results may support the fact that GA and CNV fit on an age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-disease continuum and may clarify the disease processes in AMD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699975?dopt=Abstract

The complement system is an important mediator of natural and acquired immunity. The complement system genes coding complement proteins have polymorphisms. Hereditary deficiencies of this system predispose to autoimmune conditions such as age-dependent macular degeneration or impairment of immunity against microorganisms. When different populations are compared, the frequency of complement polymorphism shows a very marked geographical distribution. The frequency of the functional polymorphism rs2230199 (Arg80Gly; C > G) in the C3 gene was determined in population from south of Iran (n = 200), using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). One hundred thirty-eight persons (69 %) were homozygous for C allele (CC or SS); fifty-six person (28 %) heterozygote GC (FS) and six people were homozygous for G allele (GG or FF) (3 %). The allele frequency was 82 % for C3S and 18 % for C3F. A distribution of C3C allele frequency in our population is different from the reports of Asians (100 %); Indians (90-98 %); African-American (93 %); Africans (99 %) and south Brazilian (97 %). However, this finding is similar with the findings Caucasian (80-82 %) ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP ); Americans (80 %); Pushtoon, Hazaras, Osbek and Tajik ethnic groups in Afghanistan (88-90 %) and Tunisian population (84 %).

Asthma is a common disease that results from both genetic and environmental risk factors. Children attending day care in the 1st year of life have lower risks for developing asthma, although the mechanism for this ""day care"" effect is largely unknown. We investigated the interactions between day care exposure in the 1st 6 mo of life and genotypes for 72 polymorphisms at 45 candidate loci and their effects on cytokine response profiles and on the development of atopic phenotypes in the 1st year of life in the Childhood Onset of Asthma (COAST) cohort of children. Six interactions (at four polymorphisms in three loci) with ""day care"" that had an effect on early-life immune phenotypes were significant at P<.001. The estimated false-discovery rate was 33%, indicating that an estimated four P values correspond to true associations. Moreover, the ""day care"" effect at some loci was accounted for by the increased number of viral infections among COAST children attending day care, whereas interactions at other loci were independent of the number of viral infections, indicating the presence of additional risk factors associated with day care environment. This study identified significant gene-environment interactions influencing the early patterning of the immune system and the subsequent development of asthma and highlights the importance of considering environmental risk factors in genetic analyses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15726497?dopt=Abstract

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) assess correlation between traits and DNA sequence variation using large numbers of genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the genome. A GWAS produces many trait-SNP associations with low p-values, but few are replicated in subsequent studies. We sought to determine if characteristics of the genomic loci associated with a trait could be used to identify initial associations with a higher chance of replication in a second cohort. Data from the age-related eye disease study (AREDS) of 100,000 SNPs on 395 subjects with and 198 without age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were employed. Loci highly associated with AMD were characterized based on the distribution of genotypes, level of significance, and clustering of adjacent SNPs also associated with AMD suggesting linkage disequilibrium or multiple effects. Forty nine loci were highly associated with AMD, including 3 loci (CFH, C2/BF, LOC387715/HTRA1) already known to contain important genetic risks for AMD. One additional locus (C3) reported during the course of this study was identified and replicated in an additional study group. Tag-SNPs and haplotypes for each locus were evaluated for association with AMD in additional cohorts to account for population differences between discovery and replication subjects, but no additional clearly significant associations were identified. Relying on a significant genotype tests using a log-additive model would have excluded 57% of the non-replicated and none of the replicated loci, while use of other SNP features and clustering might have missed true associations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19043567?dopt=Abstract

Variants in the complement cascade genes and the LOC387715/HTRA1, have been widely reported to associate with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of visual impairment in industrialized countries.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
We investigated the association between the LOC387715 A69S and complement component C3 R102G risk alleles in the Finnish case-control material and found a significant association with both variants (OR 2.98, p = 3.75 x 10(-9); non-AMD controls and OR 2.79, p = 2.78 x 10(-19), blood donor controls and OR 1.83, p = 0.008; non-AMD controls and OR 1.39, p = 0.039; blood donor controls), respectively. Previously, we have shown a strong association between complement factor H (CFH) Y402H and AMD in the Finnish population. A carrier of at least one risk allele in each of the three susceptibility loci (LOC387715, C3, CFH) had an 18-fold risk of AMD when compared to a non-carrier homozygote in all three loci. A tentative gene-gene interaction between the two major AMD-associated loci, LOC387715 and CFH, was found in this study using a multiplicative (logistic regression) model, a synergy index (departure-from-additivity model) and the mutual information method (MI), suggesting that a common causative pathway may exist for these genes. Smoking (ever vs. never) exerted an extra risk for AMD, but somewhat surprisingly, only in connection with other factors such as sex and the C3 genotype. Population attributable risks (PAR) for the CFH, LOC387715 and C3 variants were 58.2%, 51.4% and 5.8%, respectively, the summary PAR for the three variants being 65.4%.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
Evidence for gene-gene interaction between two major AMD associated loci CFH and LOC387715 was obtained using three methods, logistic regression, a synergy index and the mutual information (MI) index.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19048105?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
Ischemic stroke is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component. Pathways, including lipid metabolism, systemic chronic inflammation, coagulation, blood pressure regulation, and cellular adhesion, have been implicated in stroke pathophysiology, and candidate gene polymorphisms in these pathways have been proposed as genetic risk factors.
METHODS:
We genotyped 105 simple deletions and single nucleotide polymorphisms from 64 candidate genes in 3550 patients and 6560 control subjects from 6 case-control association studies conducted in the United States, Europe, and China. Genotyping was performed using the same immobilized probe typing system and meta-analyses were based on summary logistic regressions for each study. The primary analyses were fixed-effects meta-analyses adjusting for age and sex with additive, dominant, and recessive models of inheritance.
RESULTS:
Although 7 polymorphisms showed a nominal additive association, none remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. In contrast, after stratification for hypertension, 2 lymphotoxin-alpha polymorphisms, which are in strong linkage disequilibrium, were significantly associated among nonhypertensive individuals: LTA 252A>G (additive model; OR, 1.41 with 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.65; P=0.00002) and LTA 26Thr>Asn (OR, 1.19 with 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.34; P=0.003). LTA 252A>G remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing using either the false discovery rate or by permutation testing. The 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms showed no association in hypertensive subjects (eg, LTA 252A>G, OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.03; P=0.17).
CONCLUSIONS:
These observations may indicate an important role of LTA-mediated inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19131662?dopt=Abstract

PURPOSE:
Common genetic variation in the complement component 1 inhibitor gene (SERPING1) was recently reported to increase the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study was performed to replicate the association between SERPING1 and AMD.
METHODS:
Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging common haplotypes across SERPING1 were genotyped on 786 (The Mayo Clinic) subjects and the association with AMD studied using single SNP and haplotype association analyses. The SNP in intron 6 (rs2511989) previously reported to increase the risk of AMD was studied in an additional 1,541 subjects from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS). Association with specific subtypes of AMD and interaction with four other loci: complement factor H (CFH), age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2/LOC387715), High Temperature Requirement Factor A1 (HTRA1), complement factor B/complement component 2 (CFB/C2), and complement component 3 (C3) involved in AMD was explored.
RESULTS:
The seven tag-SNPs were not associated with AMD in the Mayo subjects (p=0.13-0.70) and rs2511989 was also not associated with AMD in the Mayo or AREDS subjects (p=0.44-0.45). Evaluation of haplotypes across SERPING1 did not reveal association with AMD (p=0.14-0.97). SNPs were not associated with AMD subtypes (early, geographic atrophy, or exudation). No interaction with other AMD risk variants was observed.
CONCLUSIONS:
We were unable to replicate the reported association between SERPING1 and AMD in two independent groups of subjects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19169411?dopt=Abstract

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive disease and major cause of severe visual loss. Toward the discovery of tools for early identification of AMD susceptibility, we evaluated the combined predictive capability of proteomic and genomic AMD biomarkers. We quantified plasma carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP) oxidative protein modifications and CEP autoantibodies by ELISA in 916 AMD and 488 control donors. CEP adducts are uniquely generated from oxidation of docosahexaenoate-containing lipids that are abundant in the retina. Mean CEP adduct and autoantibody levels were found to be elevated in AMD plasma by approximately 60 and approximately 30%, respectively. The odds ratio for both CEP markers elevated was 3-fold greater or more in AMD than in control patients. Genotyping was performed for AMD risk polymorphisms associated with age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2), high temperature requirement factor A1 (HTRA1), complement factor H, and complement C3, and the risk of AMD was predicted based on genotype alone or in combination with the CEP markers. The AMD risk predicted for those exhibiting elevated CEP markers and risk genotypes was 2-3-fold greater than the risk based on genotype alone. AMD donors carrying the ARMS2 and HTRA1 risk alleles were the most likely to exhibit elevated CEP markers. The results compellingly demonstrate higher mean CEP marker levels in AMD plasma over a broad age range. Receiver operating characteristic curves suggest that CEP markers alone can discriminate between AMD and control plasma donors with approximately 76% accuracy and in combination with genomic markers provide up to approximately 80% discrimination accuracy. Plasma CEP marker levels were altered slightly by several demographic and health factors that warrant further study. We conclude that CEP plasma biomarkers, particularly in combination with genomic markers, offer a potential early warning system for assessing susceptibility to this blinding, multifactorial disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19202148?dopt=Abstract

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a late onset vision disorder. Recent studies demonstrate that alterations in complement cascade genes are associated with AMD. Of the three identified complement loci, variants in complement factor H (CFH) have the highest impact as does an independent locus at 10q26. Our matched case-control study using the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) cohort confirms and extends the associations in these loci. Subjects were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from CFH, complement component 2 (C2), complement component 3 (C3), complement factor B (CFB), age-related maculopathy susceptibility (ARMS2), HtrA serine peptidase 1 (HTRA1), and apolipoprotein E (APOE). Individual SNPs, and haplotypes showed risk trends consistent with those seen in other population studies for CFH, C3, C2, and CFB. SNP rs10490924 on chromosome 10 in exon 1 of the ARMS2 gene showed a highly significant association with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.2 (95% CI 2.4-4.2) for the risk allele and rs11200638 located in the proximal promoter region of HTRA1 showed a higher significant association with an OR of 3.4 (95% CI 2.5-4.6) with our AMD cases. We found that APOE haplotypes were not significantly associated with disease status. Adjustments for other risk factors did not significantly alter the observed associations. This study validates the complement pathway's involvement in AMD and suggests that allelic variants in complement genes have a direct role in disease. These results also support previous findings that variants in the region of 10q26 exert an independent risk for AMD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19259132?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, complex disorder; however, genetic factors have been suggested to play a role in the disease development. We therefore conducted a multi-locus genetic study examining the potential associations of candidate gene variants in inflammation, thrombosis, coagulation, and lipid metabolism pathways, individually or interactively, with risk of recurrent VTE.
METHODS:
Using DNA samples collected at baseline in the Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism trial (PREVENT), we genotyped 86 candidate genes polymorphisms among 43 individuals who subsequently developed recurrent VTE and among 396 individuals who remained free of recurrent event over a mean follow-up period of 2.1 years to prospectively determine whether these gene polymorphisms contribute to the risk of recurrent VTE.
RESULTS:
Using a single-marker 'uncorrected' analysis, CCR5 A(-2459)G [rs1799864], MMP3 5A(-1171)6A [rs3025058] and PON1 gln192arg [rs662] gene variants were associated with increased risk, and CETP C(-629)A [rs1800775] gene variant with reduced risk of recurrent VTE, respectively. Furthermore, potentially important gene-gene-interactions were detected by the Monte Carlo Markov chain Logic Regression method.
CONCLUSIONS:
Although the present findings are hypothesis-generating and require confirmation in an independent investigation, our study provides a practical example of detecting epistasis in common, complex diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19263529?dopt=Abstract

OBJECTIVE:
Genetic risk factors for essential hypertension are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess the association of 77 previously characterized gene variants in 52 candidate genes from various biological pathways with blood pressure (BP) progression and incident hypertension.
METHODS:
We analyzed data from 18 738 white women who participated in a prospective cohort study and were free of hypertension at baseline. BP progression at 48 months and incident hypertension during the entire follow-up according to the different genotypes were assessed by logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards models, respectively.
RESULTS:
At 48 months of follow-up, 7889 of 16 635 women (47.4%) had BP progression. Only three of 70 polymorphisms with a minor allele frequency of at least 2% had a significant association with BP progression. The odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] for 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801133 (minor allele T), natriuretic peptide precursor A (NPPA) rs5063 (minor allele A) and NPPA rs5065 (minor allele C) were 1.05 (1.00-1.10), 0.84 (0.76-0.94) and 0.93 (0.88-1.00), respectively. After adjustment for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, only the NPPA rs5063 association remained significant. During a median follow-up of 9.8 years, 5540 of 18 738 women developed incident hypertension. Only five of 70 polymorphisms were significantly associated with incident hypertension. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for interleukin 6 (IL-6) rs1800795 (minor allele C), MTHFR rs1801133, NPPA rs5063, nitric oxide synthase 3 rs1799983 (minor allele T) and transforming growth factor, beta 1 rs1800469 (minor allele T) were 0.96 (0.92-1.00), 1.06 (1.02-1.10), 0.88 (0.80-0.96), 1.05 (1.01-1.09) and 1.05 (1.01-1.10), respectively. After adjustment for multiple testing, none of these associations remained significant.
CONCLUSION:
NPPA gene polymorphisms may have a role in BP progression and incident hypertension. Our data also provide moderate confirmatory evidence of association between MTHFR rs1801133 and the development of hypertension.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19330901?dopt=Abstract

PURPOSE:
Tenomodulin (TNMD) is located in the X-chromosome encoding a putative angiogenesis inhibitor which is expressed in retina. Associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms of TNMD with the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were examined.
METHODS:
Six markers covering 75% of the common sequence variation in the coding region of TNMD and 10 kb up- and downstream were genotyped in a sample consisting of 89 men and 175 women with exudative AMD, 18 men and 25 women with atrophic AMD, and 55 men and 113 women without AMD. All participants were over 65 years old and did not have diabetes mellitus. Due to the chromosomal locus, the association of genotypes with AMD was assessed genderwise.
RESULTS:
Three markers, rs1155974, rs2073163, and rs7890586, were associated with a risk of AMD in women. In comparison to women with other genotypes, the women who were homozygous for the minor allele (genotypes rs1155974-TT or rs2073163-CC) had 2.6 fold (p=0.021) or 1.9 fold (p=0.067) risk for having AMD, respectively. These differences were due to the unequal prevalence of exudative AMD. In comparison to women who were homozygous for the major alleles, the women with rs1155974-TT genotype had a 2.8 fold risk (p=0.021 in additive model; p=0.022 in recessive model) for exudative AMD, and the women with rs2073163-CC genotype had a 1.8 fold risk (p=0.09 in additive model; p=0.038 in recessive model). Furthermore, women carrying the rare rs7890586-AA genotype had a significantly smaller risk for having AMD than women with the other genotypes (odds ratio 0.083; p=0.001 in recessive model), but due to the low frequency of this genotype, this finding must be interpreted cautiously. The false discovery rate was <10% for all of the aforementioned results.
CONCLUSIONS:
On the basis of the putative antiangiogenic role of TNMD and the present genetic associations of TNMD with AMD in women, we suggest that TNMD could be a novel candidate gene for AMD. These results should be confirmed in further studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19381347?dopt=Abstract

Population-based studies have established an association between migraine and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We sought to investigate whether genetic variants implicated in CVD are associated with migraine. We performed an association study among 25,713 women participating in the Women's Health Study, with information on 77 previously characterized polymorphisms. Migraine and migraine aura status were self-reported. We used logistic regression to investigate the genotype-migraine association. At baseline, 4705 (18.3%) women reported history of migraine; 39.6% of the 3306 women with active migraine indicated aura. Regarding any history of migraine, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for TNF rs673 were 0.52 (0.30 to 0.89), for TGFB1 rs1800469 0.93 (0.89 to 0.98), and for CCR2 rs1799864 1.12 (1.03 to 1.21). Among active migraine with aura, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.35 (1.0 to 1.81) for TNF rs1800750, 1.13 (1.02 to 1.26) for TNF rs1800629, and 1.22 (1.07 to 1.40) for CCR2 rs1799864; among active migraine without aura, 0.9 (0.84 to 0.97) for TGFB1 rs1800469, 1.13 (1.01 to 1.27) for NOS3 rs3918226, and 1.12 (1.02 to 1.24) for IL9 rs2069885. After correction for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, none of the results remained significant. Our data suggest an association of polymorphisms implicated in inflammatory pathways and migraine in women. TNF, CCR2, TGFB1, NOS3, and IL9 warrant further investigation.
PERSPECTIVE:
This article presents results from an association study of 77 polymorphisms, implicated in CVD, and migraine. Variants in TNF, CCR2, TGFB1, NOS3, and IL9 were found to be associated with migraine but did not remain significant after adjustment for multiple testing.

PURPOSE:
Several genes encoding complement system components and fragments are associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study was conducted to determine whether alterations in circulating levels of these markers of complement activation and regulation are also independently associated with advanced AMD and whether they are related to AMD genotypes.
METHODS:
Plasma and DNA samples were selected from individuals in our AMD registry who had progressed to or developed the advanced stages of AMD, including 58 with geographic atrophy and 62 with neovascular disease. Subjects of similar age and sex, but without AMD, and who did not progress were included as controls (n = 60). Plasma complement components (C3, CFB, CFI, CFH, and factor D) and activation fragments (Bb, C3a, C5a, iC3b, and SC5b-9) were analyzed. DNA samples were genotyped for seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms in six genes previously shown to be associated with AMD: CFB, CFH, C2, C3, and CFI and the LOC387715/ARMS2 gene region. The association between AMD and each complement biomarker was assessed by using logistic regression, controlling for age, sex, and proinflammatory risk factors: smoking and body mass index (BMI). Functional genomic analyses were performed to assess the relationship between the complement markers and genotypes. Concordance, or C, statistics were calculated to assess the effect of complement components and activation fragments in an AMD gene-environment prediction model.
RESULTS:
The highest quartiles of Bb and C5a were significantly associated with advanced AMD, when compared with the lowest quartiles. In multivariate models without genetic variants, the odds ratio (OR) for Bb was 3.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-8.6), and the OR for C5a was 3.6 (95% CI = 1.2-10.3). With adjustment for genetic variants, these ORs were substantially higher. The alternative pathway regulator CFH was inversely associated with AMD in the model without genotypes (OR = 0.3; P = 0.01). Positive associations were found between BMI and plasma C3, CFB, CFH, iC3b, and C3a. There were also significant associations between C5a fragment and LOC387715/ARMS2 and C3 genotypes (P for trend = 0.02, 0.04), respectively. C statistics for models with behavioral and genetic factors increased to 0.94 +/- 0.20 with the addition of C3a, Bb, and C5a.
CONCLUSIONS:
Increased levels of activation fragments Bb and C5a are independently associated with AMD. Higher BMI is related to increased levels of complement components. C5a is associated with AMD genotypes. C statistics are stronger with the addition of C3a, Bb, and C5a in predictive models. Results implicate ongoing activation of the alternative complement pathway in AMD pathogenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661236?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent cause of blindness in Western societies. Variants in the genes encoding complement factor H (CFH), complement component 3 (C3) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) have repeatedly been shown to confer significant risks for AMD; however, their role in disease progression and thus their potential relevance for interventional therapeutic approaches remains unknown.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
Here, we analyzed association between variants in CFH, C3 and ARMS2 and disease progression of geographic atrophy (GA) due to AMD. A quantitative phenotype of disease progression was computed based on longitudinal observations by fundus autofluorescence imaging. In a subset of 99 cases with pure bilateral GA, variants in CFH (Y402H), C3 (R102G), and ARMS2 (A69S) are associated with disease (P = 1.6x10(-9), 3.2x10(-3), and P = 2.6x10(-12), respectively) when compared to 612 unrelated healthy control individuals. In cases, median progression rate of GA over a mean follow-up period of 3.0 years was 1.61 mm(2)/year with high concordance between fellow eyes. No association between the progression rate and any of the genetic risk variants at the three loci was observed (P>0.13).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
This study confirms that variants at CFH, C3, and ARMS2 confer significant risks for GA due to AMD. In contrast, our data indicate no association of these variants with disease progression which may have important implications for future treatment strategies. Other, as yet unknown susceptibilities may influence disease progression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19823576?dopt=Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Complement component 3 (C3) is a novel determinant of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Gene-nutrient interactions with dietary fat may affect MetS risk.
OBJECTIVES:
The objectives were to determine the relation between C3 polymorphisms and MetS and whether interaction with plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), a biomarker of dietary PUFA, modulate this relation.
DESIGN:
C3 polymorphisms (rs11569562, rs2250656, rs1047286, rs2230199, rs8107911, rs344548, rs344550, rs2241393, rs7257062, rs163913, and rs2230204), biochemical measurements, and plasma fatty acids were measured in the LIPGENE-SUpplementation en VItamines et Minéraux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) study in MetS cases and matched controls (n = 1754).
RESULTS:
Two single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with MetS. rs11569562 GG homozygotes had decreased MetS risk compared with minor A allele carriers [odds ratio (OR): 0.53; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.82; P = 0.009], which was augmented by high plasma PUFA status (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.93; P = 0.04). GG homozygotes had lower C3 concentrations than those in AA homozygotes (P = 0.03) and decreased risk of hypertriglyceridemia compared with A allele carriers (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.92; P = 0.02), which was further ameliorated by an increase in long-chain n-3 (omega-3) PUFAs (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.97; P = 0.04) or a decrease in n-6 PUFAs (OR: 0.32; CI: 0.16, 0.62; P = 0.002). rs2250656 AA homozygotes had increased MetS risk relative to minor G allele carriers (OR: 1.78; CI: 1.19, 2.70; P = 0.02), which was exacerbated by low n-6 PUFA status (OR: 2.20; CI: 1.09, 4.55; P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION:
Plasma PUFAs may modulate the susceptibility to MetS that is conferred by C3 polymorphisms, which suggests novel gene-nutrient interactions. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19828715?dopt=Abstract

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of blindness in the elderly. Caucasian patients are predominantly affected by the dry form of AMD, whereas Japanese patients have predominantly the wet form of AMD and/or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Although genetic association in the 10q26 (ARMS2/HTRA1) region has been established in many ethnic groups for dry-type AMD, typical wet-type AMD, and PCV, the contribution of the 1q32 (CFH) region seem to differ among these groups. Here we show a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ARMS2/HTRA1 locus is associated in the whole genome for Japanese typical wet-type AMD (rs10490924: p = 4.1 x 10(-4), OR = 4.16) and PCV (rs10490924: p = 3.7 x 10(-8), OR = 2.72) followed by CFH (rs800292: p = 7.4 x 10(-5), OR = 2.08; p = 2.6 x 10(-4), OR = 2.00), which differs from previous studies in Caucasian populations. Moreover, a SNP (rs2241394) in complement component C3 gene showed significant association with PCV (p = 2.5 x 10(-3), OR = 3.47). We conclude that dry-type AMD, typical wet-type AMD, and PCV have both common and distinct genetic risks that become apparent when comparing Japanese versus Caucasian populations.

PURPOSE:
Major genetic factors for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have recently been identified as susceptibility risk factors, underlying the role of the complement pathway in AMD. Our purpose was to analyze the role of the R102G polymorphism of the complement component (C3) gene in a French population, in a case-control study.
METHODS:
A total of 1,080 patients with exudative AMD and 406 controls were recruited and genotyped for Y402H of complement factor H (CFH), rs10490924 of age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2), and R102G of the C3 gene.
RESULTS:
The distribution of the R102G genotypes was significantly different in the AMD patients compared to controls (p=0.02). The Odds Ratio compared to C/C individuals was 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.8) for C/G individuals and 1.4 (95% CI 0.8-2.4) for G/G individuals. In a dominant model, the adjusted Odds Ratio for carriers of the G allele is 1.4 (95% CI 1.0-1.9; p=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS:
Our study shows C3 to be a moderate susceptibility gene for exudative AMD in the French population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20664795?dopt=Abstract

OBJECTIVES:
To evaluate the independent and joint effects of genetic factors and environmental variables on advanced forms of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), including geographic atrophy and choroidal neovascularization, and to develop a predictive model with genetic and environmental factors included.
METHODS:
Demographic information, including age at onset, smoking status, and body mass index, was collected for 1844 participants. Genotypes were evaluated for 8 variants in 5 genes related to AMD. Unconditional logistic regression analyses were performed to generate a risk predictive model.
RESULTS:
All genetic variants showed a strong association with AMD. Multivariate odds ratios were 3.52 (95% confidence interval, 2.08-5.94) for complement factor H, CFH rs1061170 CC, 4.21 (2.30-7.70) for CFH rs2274700 CC, 0.46 (0.27-0.80) for C2 rs9332739 CC/CG, 0.44 (0.30-0.66) for CFB rs641153 TT/CT, 10.99 (6.04-19.97) for HTRA1/LOC387715 rs10490924 TT, and 2.66 (1.43-4.96) for C3 rs2230199 GG. Smoking was independently associated with advanced AMD after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and all genetic variants.
CONCLUSION:
CFH confers more risk to the bilaterality of geographic atrophy, whereas HTRA1/LOC387715 contributes more to the bilaterality of choroidal neovascularization. C3 confers more risk for geographic atrophy than choroidal neovascularization. Risk models with combined genetic and environmental factors have notable discrimination power.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
Early detection and risk prediction of AMD could help to improve the prognosis of AMD and to reduce the outcome of blindness. Targeting high-risk individuals for surveillance and clinical interventions may help reduce disease burden.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21402993?dopt=Abstract

A major goal of personalized medicine is to pre-symptomatically identify individuals at high risk for disease using knowledge of each individual's particular genetic profile and constellation of environmental risk factors. With the identification of several well-replicated risk factors for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of legal blindness in older adults, this previously unreachable goal is beginning to seem less elusive. However, recently developed algorithms have either been much less accurate than expected, given the strong effects of the identified risk factors, or have not been applied to independent datasets, leaving unknown how well they would perform in the population at large. We sought to increase accuracy by using novel modeling strategies, including multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and grammatical evolution of neural networks (GENN), in addition to the traditional logistic regression approach. Furthermore, we rigorously designed and tested our models in three distinct datasets: a Vanderbilt-Miami (VM) clinic-based case-control dataset, a VM family dataset, and the population-based Age-related Maculopathy Ancillary (ARMA) Study cohort. Using a consensus approach to combine the results from logistic regression and GENN models, our algorithm was successful in differentiating between high- and low-risk groups (sensitivity 77.0%, specificity 74.1%). In the ARMA cohort, the positive and negative predictive values were 63.3% and 70.7%, respectively. We expect that future efforts to refine this algorithm by increasing the sample size available for model building, including novel susceptibility factors as they are discovered, and by calibrating the model for diverse populations will improve accuracy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21455292?dopt=Abstract

This study was to investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms in complement component 2 (C2), complement factor B (CFB) and complement component 3 (C3) with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a Korean population and the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in the development of AMD. A total of six SNPs that are located in the C2 (rs547154, rs9332739), CFB (rs4151667, rs641153) and C3 (rs1047286, rs2230199) genes were genotyped in 350 samples comprised of 153 cases, 197 controls. The risk allele frequencies for rs547154 in C2 were 6.54% and 8.12% in AMD patients and controls. Those for rs641153 in CFB were 6.54% and 8.63% in AMD patients and controls. The risk allele frequency for rs9332739 in C2 (AMD, 0.65%, control, 2.03%) and rs4151667 in CFB (AMD, 0.65%, control, 1.78%) was very low. The protective allele of four SNPs was not significantly associated with decreased risk for AMD (P = 0.427, P = 0.199, P = 0.312, P = 0.303, respectively). The homozygotes for the protective allele of four SNPs were not significantly associated with decreased risk for AMD (P = 0.324, P = 0.474, P = 0.309, P = 0.411, respectively). The genetic effect of two SNPs in C3 could not be investigated because the variants were not observed. There was no evidence to support an interaction of these SNPs with LOC387715/HTRA1 variants or with environmental exposure like smoking. In conclusion, the genetic effect of C2, CFB and C3 polymorphisms, which are known to be important for AMD in Caucasian, were not significant in the Korean population. The low minor allele frequency of these SNPs in Koreans might have affected the results of this study. Ethnic differences in the roles of C2, CFB and C3 in conferring a risk of AMD should be further investigated.

The C3 component of complement has different roles in kidney disease and its local production in donor kidney may affect allograft function and rejection after organ transplantation. A single base substitution in c3 gene (rs2230199), defines two common allelic variants with different mobility on gel electrophoresis: S (Slow) and F (Fast). In order to evaluate the effect of this polymorphism on acute renal allograft rejection, one hundred samples of donor and recipients were collected and genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP method. The allelic frequencies were: C3S=0.791, C3F=0.209. There was no significant association between recipient's genotype and acute rejection (p value<0.05). No correlation between donor genotype and acute rejection was also present. Patients were divided into four groups, according to the recipient and donor genotypes: SS recipients and FS or FF donor, SS recipient and donor, FF or FS recipient and SS donor and FS or FF recipient and donor. There was no significant difference in rate of acute rejection between groups. Although the results didn't find any association between C3 complement polymorphisms and acute allograft rejection, there was no acute rejection in FS or FF donors and SS recipient group.

PURPOSE:
To investigate whether the 2 subtypes of advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD), choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and geographic atrophy (GA) segregate separately in families and to identify which genetic variants are associated with these 2 subtypes.
DESIGN:
Sibling correlation study and genome-wide association study (GWAS).
PARTICIPANTS:
For the sibling correlation study, 209 sibling pairs with advanced AMD were included. For the GWAS, 2594 participants with advanced AMD subtypes and 4134 controls were included. Replication cohorts included 5383 advanced AMD participants and 15 240 controls.
METHODS:
Participants had the AMD grade assigned based on fundus photography, examination, or both. To determine heritability of advanced AMD subtypes, a sibling correlation study was performed. For the GWAS, genome-wide genotyping was conducted and 6 036 699 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were imputed. Then, the SNPs were analyzed with a generalized linear model controlling for genotyping platform and genetic ancestry. The most significant associations were evaluated in independent cohorts.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
Concordance of advanced AMD subtypes in sibling pairs and associations between SNPs with GA and CNV advanced AMD subtypes.
RESULTS:
The difference between the observed and expected proportion of siblings concordant for the same subtype of advanced AMD was different to a statistically significant degree (P = 4.2 × 10(-5)), meaning that in siblings of probands with CNV or GA, the same advanced subtype is more likely to develop. In the analysis comparing participants with CNV to those with GA, a statistically significant association was observed at the ARMS2/HTRA1 locus (rs10490924; odds ratio [OR], 1.47; P = 4.3 × 10(-9)), which was confirmed in the replication samples (OR, 1.38; P = 7.4 × 10(-14) for combined discovery and replication analysis).
CONCLUSIONS:
Whether CNV versus GA develops in a patient with AMD is determined in part by genetic variation. In this large GWAS meta-analysis and replication analysis, the ARMS2/HTRA1 locus confers increased risk for both advanced AMD subtypes, but imparts greater risk for CNV than for GA. This locus explains a small proportion of the excess sibling correlation for advanced AMD subtype. Other loci were detected with suggestive associations that differ for advanced AMD subtypes and deserve follow-up in additional studies.

PURPOSE:
To evaluate the pharmacogenetic relationship between genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and response to treatment with ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) or bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech) for neovascular AMD.
DESIGN:
Clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS:
Eight hundred thirty-four (73%) of 1149 patients participating in the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials (CATT) were recruited through 43 CATT clinical centers.
METHODS:
Each patient was genotyped for SNPs rs1061170 (CFH), rs10490924 (ARMS2), rs11200638 (HTRA1), and rs2230199 (C3), using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES:
Genotypic frequencies were compared with clinical measures of response to therapy at one year, including mean visual acuity (VA), mean change in VA, 15-letter or more increase in VA, retinal thickness, mean change in total foveal thickness, presence of fluid on OCT, presence of leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA), mean change in lesion size, and mean number of injections administered. Differences in response by genotype were evaluated with tests of linear trend calculated from logistic regression models for categorical outcomes and linear regression models for continuous outcomes. To adjust for multiple comparisons, P≤0.01 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS:
No statistically significant differences in response by genotype were identified for any of the clinical measures studied. Specifically, there were no high-risk alleles that predicted final VA or change in VA, the degree of anatomic response (fluid on OCT or FA, retinal thickness, change in total foveal thickness, change in lesion size), or the number of injections. Furthermore, a stepwise analysis failed to show a significant epistatic interaction among the variants analyzed; that is, response did not vary by the number of risk alleles present. The lack of association was similar whether patients were treated with ranibizumab or bevacizumab or whether they received monthly or pro re nata dosing.
CONCLUSIONS:
Although specific alleles for CFH, ARMS2, HTRA1, and C3 may predict the development of AMD, they did not predict response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

PURPOSE:
To determine the association of genetic variants in known age-related macular degeneration (AMD) risk-associated genes with outcome of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in neovascular AMD.
DESIGN:
Prospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS:
We enrolled 224 consecutive patients with neovascular AMD at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Australia.
METHODS:
Patients were treated with 3 initial monthly ranibizumab or bevacizumab injections followed by 9 months of ""as required"" injections based on clinician's decision at each follow-up visit according to retreatment criteria. Seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in known AMD risk-associated genes including CFH (rs800292, rs3766404, rs1061170, rs2274700 and rs393955), HTRA1 (rs11200638), CFHR1-5 (rs10922153, rs16840639, rs6667243, and rs1853883), LOC387715/ARMS2 (rs3793917 and rs10490924), C3 (rs2230199 and rs1047286), C2 (rs547154), CFB (rs641153) and F13B (rs6003) were examined. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the role of each SNP in treatment outcome.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
The influence of selected SNPs on mean change in visual acuity (VA) at 12 months.
RESULTS:
Mean baseline VA was 51 ± 16.8 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters. Overall, the mean change in VA from baseline was +3.2 ± 14.9 letters at 12 months. The AA (homozygote risk) genotype at rs11200638 - HTRA1 promoter SNP (P = 0.001) and GG (homozygote risk) genotype at rs10490924 (A69S) in LOC387715/ARMS2 (P = 0.002) were each significantly associated with poorer VA outcome at 12 months after multiple correction. Mean ± standard deviation change in VA from baseline in patients with AA genotype at rs11200638 was -2.9 ± 15.2 letters after 12 months compared with +5.1 ± 14.1 letters in patients with AG or GG genotypes at this SNP. Patients with either of these genotypes were also significantly more likely to lose >15 letters after 12 months. SNPs rs11200638 and rs10490924 were in high linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.92). None of the other examined SNPs was associated with outcome.
CONCLUSIONS:
The HTRA1 promoter SNP (rs11200638) and A69S at LOC387715/ARMS2 were associated with a poorer visual outcome for ranibizumab or bevacizumab treatment in neovascular AMD, suggesting strong pharmacogenetic associations with anti-VEGF treatment. This finding could aid in applying more individualized treatment regimens based on patients' genotype to achieve optimal treatment response in AMD.

We identified 19 loci associated at P < 5 × 10(-8). These loci show enrichment for genes involved in the regulation of complement activity, lipid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. Our results include seven loci with associations reaching P < 5 × 10(-8) for the first time, near the genes COL8A1-FILIP1L, IER3-DDR1, SLC16A8, TGFBR1, RAD51B, ADAMTS9 and B3GALTL.

Dengue disease is a mosquito-borne infection caused by Dengue virus. Infection may be asymptomatic or variably manifest as mild Dengue fever (DF) to the most severe form, Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Mechanisms that influence disease severity are not understood. Complement, an integral component of the immune system, is activated during Dengue infection and the degree of activation increases with disease severity. Activation of the complement alternative pathway is influenced by polymorphisms within activation (factor B rs12614/rs641153, C3 rs2230199) and regulatory [complement factor H (CFH) rs800292] proteins, collectively termed a complotype. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the complotype influences disease severity during secondary Dengue infection. In addition to the complotype, we also assessed two other disease-associated CFH polymorphisms (rs1061170, rs3753394) and a structural polymorphism within the CFH protein family. We did not detect any significant association between the examined polymorphisms and Dengue infection severity in the Thai population. However, the minor allele frequencies of the factor B and C3 polymorphisms were less than 10%, so our study was not sufficiently powered to detect an association at these loci. We were also unable to detect a direct interaction between CFH and Dengue NS1 using both recombinant NS1 and DV2-infected culture supernatants. We conclude that the complotype does not influence secondary Dengue infection severity in the Thai population.

OBJECTIVE:
Risk factors for susceptibility to bacterial meningitis have been identified, but basic causes of inter-individual differences in susceptibility are largely unknown.
METHODS:
To determine the effect of genetic variation in the complement system on susceptibility to bacterial meningitis we performed a prospective nationwide genetic association study in patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis. We genotyped 17 common SNPs (minor allele frequencies >5%) in genes coding for complement components and evaluated functional consequences by measuring complement levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.
RESULTS:
From March 2006 to June 2009 we included 636 adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis. DNA was available for 439 patients and 302 controls. Rs1047286 (Pro314Leu) in complement component 3 was associated with reduced susceptibility to bacterial meningitis after correction for multiple testing: the protective Leu/Leu genotype was found in 5 of 435 patients (1%) compared to 15 of 302 controls (5%; odds ratio [OR] 4.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.62-12.50, p = 0.0017). Rs1047286 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with Rs2230199 (C3 Arg102Gly), of which the Arg/Arg genotype was associated with higher CSF levels of C3 and lower levels of C5a and terminal complement complex (TCC; soluble C5b-9), indicating decreased consumption of C3 and less activation of the complement system. Rs1047286 was associated with susceptibility albeit not significantly after Bonferroni correction (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01-1.87; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS:
This study shows an association between a common single nucleotide polymorphism in C3 and susceptibility for community-acquired bacterial meningitis.

We selected and genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of four complement pathway genes, including rs800292 and rs1410996 of complement H (CFH), rs9332739 of complement 2 (C2), rs4151667 of complement factor B (CFB), and rs2241394 and rs2230199 of complement 3 (C3). The associations between SNPs and AMD, adjusted by age and sex, were assessed by using logistic regression models and haplotype association analysis.
RESULTS:
In our study, two SNPs of CFH and their haplotypes were associated significantly with AMD, and the adjusted odd ratios (ORs) were 2.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-4.79) for rs800292 (genotype GG versus AA), 2.49 (95% CI 1.24-5.00) for rs1410996 (genotype TT versus CC), and 4.45 (95% CI 2.32-8.55) for haplotype block of rs800292-rs1410996 (haplotype G-C versus A-C), respectively. The haplotype of C2/CFB also was associated significantly with AMD, and the adjusted OR was 8.86 (95% CI 1.88-41.69) for the haplotype block of rs9332739-rs4151667 (haplotype G-A versus G-T), though no relationship was found in genotype association analysis of the two SNPs of C2/CFB. With the sample size of our study, no relationship was found for AMD and the two SNPs of C3.
CONCLUSIONS:
Gene variants in CFH and C2/CFB contribute to AMD in the Chinese population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23233260?dopt=Abstract

Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in complement component 3 (CC3) are associated with the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), however, this association is not consistent among studies. To thoroughly address this issue, we performed an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the association between nine SNPs in the CC3 gene and AMD risk. A search was conducted of the PubMed database through 3rd Aug, 2014. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. Based on the search criteria for manuscripts reporting AMD susceptibility related to CC3 in nine SNPs, 57 case-control studies from 22 different articles were retrieved. Significantly positive associations were found for the rs2230199 C/G SNP and AMD in the Caucasian population, as well as for the rs1047286 C/T SNP. Moreover, a relationship between the rs11569536 G/A SNP and AMD was detected. By contrast, a negative association was observed between rs2250656 A/G SNP and AMD risk. The present meta-analysis suggests that these four SNPs in the CC3 gene are potentially associated with the risk of AMD development. Further studies using larger sample sizes and accounting for gene-environment interactions should be conducted to elucidate the role of CC3 gene polymorphisms in AMD risk.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition that leads to severe vision loss and dysregulation of the complement system is thought to be associated with the disease. To investigate associations of polymorphisms in AMD susceptibility genes with systemic complement activation, 2655 individuals were genotyped for 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near 23 AMD associated risk genes. Component 3 (C3) and its catabolic fragment C3d were measured in serum and AMD staging was performed using multimodal imaging. The C3d/C3 ratio was calculated and associations with environmental factors, SNPs and various haplotypes of complement factor H (CFH) genes and complement factor B (CFB) genes were analyzed. Linear models were built to measure the influence of genetic variants on the C3d/C3 ratio. The study cohort included 1387 patients with AMD and 1268 controls. Higher C3d/C3 ratios were found for current smoker (p = 0.002), higher age (p = 1.56 × 10(-7)), AMD phenotype (p = 1.15 × 10(-11)) and the two SNPs in the C3 gene rs6795735 (p = 0.04) and rs2230199 (p = 0.04). Lower C3d/C3 ratios were found for diabetes (p = 2.87 × 10(-6)), higher body mass index (p = 1.00 × 10(-13)), the SNPs rs1410996 (p = 0.0001), rs800292 (p = 0.003), rs12144939 (p = 4.60 × 10(-6)) in CFH, rs4151667 (p = 1.01 × 10(-5)) in CFB and individual haplotypes in CFH and CFB. The linear model revealed a corrected R-square of 0.063 including age, smoking status, gender, and genetic polymorphisms explaining 6.3% of the C3d/C3 ratio. After adding the AMD status the corrected R-square was 0.067. In conclusion, none of the evaluated genetic polymorphisms showed an association with increased systemic complement activation apart from two SNPs in the C3 gene. Major genetic and non-genetic factors for AMD were not associated with systemic complement activation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675670?dopt=Abstract

PURPOSE:
To study the association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4073 in the interleukin-8 (IL-8) promoter region with the diagnosis and age of onset of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in association with the known genetic risk factors for AMD and tobacco smoking.
METHODS:
Medical records, smoking history and angiograms or fundus photographs of 301 patients with exudative AMD, 72 patients with dry AMD and 119 control subjects were analysed retrospectively. The associations of IL-8 rs4073 A→T, CFH rs1061170 T→C, ARMS2 rs10490924 G→T and C3 rs2230199 C→G SNPs with the presence of AMD and with the age of onset of exudative AMD were analysed.
RESULTS:
Younger age of exudative AMD onset was associated with the homozygous AA genotype of IL-8 rs4073 (p = 0.009, Mann-Whitney U-test), CC genotype of CFH rs1061170 (p = 0.016), TT genotype of ARMS2 rs10490924 (p = 0.001) and with current smoking (p = 0.002). The risk alleles C in CFH rs1061170 (p < 0.0001, Pearson chi-square) and T in ARMS2 rs10490924 (p < 0.0001), as well as smoking (p < 0.0001), were more prevalent in AMD patients compared with controls. No association was found between the IL-8 rs4073 genotype and the presence of AMD.
CONCLUSION:
Out of the factors associated with the earlier onset of exudative AMD, only the genotype of IL-8 rs4073 did not appear as a risk factor for AMD in general. IL-8 may have a role in accelerating the development of the choroidal neovascularization in exudative AMD.

The association between the rs2230199 C>G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in complement component 3 and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) risk has been examined extensively but the results are not consistent among studies. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of all available studies on this SNP in relation to AMD. The comprehensive databases of PubMed, Medline, Web of Knowledge, CNKI, and Google Scholar were searched for case-control studies investigating the association between the rs2230199 polymorphism and AMD susceptibility. ORs with 95%CIs were estimated to assess the association. Sensitivity analysis, test of heterogeneity, cumulative meta-analysis, and assessment of bias were also performed. A total of 15 published studies including 5593 cases and 5181 controls were used in this meta-analysis. Overall, the rs2230299 SNP was significantly associated with the risk of AMD in the overall population under the additive model (OR = 1.571, 95%CI = 1.414-1.745, P = 0.000), dominant model (OR = 1.681, 95%CI = 1.521-1.858, P = 0.000), and allelic model (OR = 1.597, 95%CI = 1.470-1.734, P = 0.000). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the same results were found in Caucasian populations, while no significant correlations were found in Asian populations for all comparison models. In conclusion, our meta-analysis provides evidence that the rs2230199 polymorphism contributes to the development of AMD. Further large-scale multicenter epidemiological studies are warranted to confirm this finding.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26505407?dopt=Abstract

IMPORTANCE:
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the CFH, ARMS2, C3, LIPC, CFB, and C2 genes are associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD); however, the association of these SNPs with angiographic features of neovascular AMD has been inconsistent in previous studies, and to date, no studies have addressed their association with features on optical coherence tomography.
OBJECTIVE:
To evaluate the influence of genotype of SNPs previously associated with AMD on the phenotype of neovascular lesions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
Participants for this cross-sectional study were recruited from the 1185 patients enrolled in the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT), a randomized clinical trial. Eligibility criteria for CATT specified that eyes have choroidal neovascularization and visual acuity between 20/25 and 20/320. A subgroup of 835 patients provided blood samples from July 2010 through September 2011 and were genotyped for the SNPs rs1061170 (CFH), rs10490924 (ARMS2),rs2230199 (C3), rs10468017 (LIPC), rs4151667 (CFB), rs547154 (C2) using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Data analysis was initiated in November 2013 and completed in January 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
Pretreatment ocular characteristics on fluorescein angiography (lesion type, area of neovascularization and total lesion, retinal angiomatous proliferation) and on time-domain optical coherence tomography (presence of intraretinal, subretinal, and subretinal pigment epithelium fluid; thickness at the foveal center of the retina, subretinal fluid, and subretinal tissue complex), visual acuity, and age.
RESULTS:
A total of 835 (73%) of 1150 CATT patients were genotyped. Mean age decreased with the number of risk alleles for CFH (P < .001), ARMS2 (P < .001), and C3 (P = .005). The following results were found as the number of risk alleles increased from 0 to 1 to 2. For CFH, mean total thickness decreased from 476 to 476 to 434 µm (P = .01; adjusted for age, sex, and smoking status). For ARMS2, the mean area of the total lesion increased from 2.0 to 2.8 to 2.4 mm2 (P = .03), the proportion with retinal angiomatous proliferation lesions increased from 8% to 10% to 12% (P = .05), and the proportion with intraretinal fluid increased from 72% to 71% to 82% (P = .008). For C3, the proportion with intraretinal fluid decreased from 78% to 69% to 64% (P = .001), and the mean retinal thickness decreased from 225 to 207 to 197 µm (P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
CFH, ARMS2, and C3 were associated with specific features of neovascularization at the time patients were enrolled in CATT. Previously identified associations of ARMS2 and CFH with type of choroidal neovascularization on fluorescein angiography were not confirmed. New associations with OCT features identified in CATT need confirmation to establish whether a true association exists.

PURPOSE:
The aim of this pharmacogenetic study was to evaluate the impact of high-risk alleles in factor H, factor C3 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on the response to intravitreal bevacizumab in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a Tunisian population.
METHODS:
Ninety patients with active neovascular AMD treated with intravitreal bevacizumab injections were enrolled in the study. Treatment response was evaluated by comparing BCVA at baseline and at 12 months. Patients were classified into either ""poor responders"" (PR) or ""good responders"" (GR). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed for rs1061170 in FH, rs2230199 in C3 andrs699947, rs2010963 and rs3025039 in VEGF. The association between genotype and visual response at 12 months was assessed.
RESULTS:
Seventy-seven participants were assigned to the GR group and 13 to the PR group. No correlation was found between FH, C3 and VEGF variant alleles and treatment response. However, haplotype analysis of rs699947 ((- 2578) C/A), rs2010963 ((+ 405) C/G) and rs3025039 ((+ 936) C/T) SNPs revealed that the AGT haplotype was associated with a poor response at 12months (p = 0.048). No association was found between treatment response and the cumulative effect of all high-risk alleles of C3, FH and VEGF. All three types of CNV were found in both groups at a comparable frequency.
CONCLUSIONS:
The VEGF haplotype TGA could be used as a marker for poor visual prognosis in Tunisian patients with neovascular AMD treated with bevacizumab.
